Since colonial times Latin American and Caribbean cultures have developed against a background of cultural repression, racial conflict, political domination, colonial exploitation, and gender inequality. And yet, in the midst of all this turmoil, Latin America and the Caribbean have produced an extraordinary variety and wealth of artistic creations, ranging from literature to the visual arts, from music to film. In this course we will turn to some of the works by Latin American and Caribbean artists and writers in an attempt to illuminate and explore some of the wonders of the cultural dynamics that shape the many faces of what we call Latin America and the Caribbean.",

     "Following the definition generally accepted by the Chinese themselves, “modern” in this context refers to two large periods: that preceding the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, and that following 1949. The former (i.e., xiandai) can be pushed as far back as the Opium War of 1839-42, and the latter (i.e., dangdai) can be extended to “today.” Courses offered under this rubric examine the main literary and cultural phenomena and events taking place in China (including Taiwan and Hong Kong) over this period of one and a half centuries. Courses listed under Chinese 61 are open to students of all classes.\n\nLiterature and Revolution in 20th Century China. The revolutionary literature of 20th century China may be approached as fruitfully from the sociological point of view as from the literary one. This course will examine short stories, novels, plays, and poems in the context of their function as a political tool of the Chinese revolution. The methodology used will be developed in the first weeks of the course through extensive readings of western and translated Chinese theoretical sources, such as Marx and Engels’ The Communist Manifesto, Mao Zedong’s The Yenan Forum on Literature and Art, Leon Trotsky’s “On Literature and Art,” and other works. Among the Chinese authors to be studied in English translation are Lu Xun, Ding Ling, Lao She, Wang Anyi, Bei Dao, Wang Meng, and many others. The goal of this course is to reach a deeper understanding of the role of the artist and the art work in a communist society.",

     "Courses under this rubric will provide the student with a comprehensive view of the most frequently occurring themes in Chinese literary writings from the second millennium B.C.E. to the present. The most prominent among these themes are love (patriotic, familial, romantic, and platonic) and social protest. Individual literary genres in China have traditionally been associated, in a general way, with historical/dynastic periods. Therefore, tracing the evolution, for example, of the theme of romantic love will lead the student through the multiplicity of ways that an idea can be transformed by diverse literary mediums and different historical periods. In reaching a fundamental understanding through literature of the Chinese way of looking at a specific idea as it evolved over time, we will understand better the uniqueness of both Chinese values and institutions. Courses listed under Chinese 63 are open to students of all classes.\n\nIn 10F (63.4), Martial Heroines in Chinese Literature. In traditional China, there was strict separation between women’s and men’s functions and activities. Women were expected to participate in the domestic, inner sphere, running a household and bringing up children, while men participated in the public, outer sphere of administration, the military and business. However, though martial activities such as participation in war and acts of knight-errantry were traditionally male activities, Chinese literature boasted a long tradition of fighting women of various types. This course introduces stories of heroines and martial women in traditional literature, juxtaposed against traditional formulation of female functions, and their evolution and modern representation in film and literature.\n\nIn 11S (63.1), Storytelling in China. This course attempts to provide the student with both a general understanding of the nature of oral, performed narrative and a specific grasp of the pre-modern and contemporary oral tradition in China. The course naturally divides itself into three parts: readings in English, from both the general folklore tradition and performance theory specifically, and from the history of Chinese oral performed narrative; analysis of videotaped performances from among China’s most renowned storytellers; and the creation and performance of three versions of a short narrative in English.\n\nIn 12W (63.2), Women in China. This is a survey course of Chinese ideas and practices concerning women. The pursuit of this theme will take the student through a wide variety of Chinese literary genres and materials, including the classics, poetry, fiction, drama, biography, and law. The use of women as a focus in the organization of the course provides the selectivity that makes such comprehensiveness possible. The aim is to provide the student with an intimate portrait of the development of Chinese culture as a whole through the examination of one of its central systems. The course is designed with the presumption that an understanding of Chinese thoughts about women will lead to an enhanced understanding of Chinese thoughts about Chinese people and life in general. The material will be presented in chronological order, keeping in mind the broader time perspectives.",

Those issues, raised more than seven decades ago, have persistently engaged the central attention of modern Chinese intellectuals, and include discussions of China’s modernization (or Westernization) and of China’s vernacular language movement, debates about various political and social philosophies, questions surrounding the so-called new culture movement, and other such issues.

     "Classical Hebrew literature spans 3000 years, from the Biblical period until the advent of Jewish ‘modernity’ in the 18th-19th centuries, and reflects the lives and values of Jews in their ancient homeland and across the Ashkenazi and Sephardi diasporas. Among the outstanding products of this literature, whose effects on Jewish and Western civilization have been incalculable, are the Bible, the Midrash, and Talmud of late Antiquity. Medieval Hebrew genres include the theological and erotic poetry of Spain and Italy, the laments of the Crusades, the travelogue, ethical fables, philosophical essays, and Messianic folklore. Courses listed under Hebrew 62 are open to students of all classes.\n\nMidrash: How the Rabbis Interpreted the Bible (Identical to Jewish Studies 24.3). Midrash is the ancient Jewish term for Biblical interpretation. We examine how the Bible was interpreted by the Rabbis 1500 to 2000 years ago, at the crucial juncture in history when the Bible was being canonized in the form it now has. We focus on powerful motifs such as Creation, the Flood, Jacob and Esau, the Sacrifice of Isaac, and the Exodus, and view them through two prisms: through a wide range of ancient Midrashic texts themselves; and through one influential modern Jewish literary reading of the Midrashic themes of Genesis.",

     "A multi-disciplinary introduction to Korean history, society, and culture, this course covers pre-modern and modern periods, tracing issues such as Confucian statecraft and the consolidation of a “Korean” state, modernity and imperialism (colonization), the Korean War and national division, and the post-war democratization process. In addition to historical texts, the course examines modern Korean life through literature, religion, education, family life, gender relations, and popular media, in conjunction with political and economic transformations. Asking how and why historical events, periods, or people are represented in the way that they are will allow a critical perspective as we examine the formation of Korean culture and identity. All readings are in English. No prior knowledge of Korea or Korean language assumed.",

     "In 10F, Velazquez and the Spanish Baroque. Diego Velasquez, sometimes called the prince of painters, was Spain’s preeminent artist in the seventeenth century. This course considers his achievements as a painter, his aspirations as a courtier and gentleman, and his remarkably privileged association with his patron, King Philip IV. The class will study in depth many of Velazquez’s key works and examine how he challenged previous notions about the nature of representation, and simultaneously sought to demonstrate the “nobility” of painting.\n\nIn 11W, “The Villa Life”: Andrea Palladio and His Architectural Legacy. Historians routinely identify Andrea Palladio, the 16th-century Italian architect, as architecture’s most celebrated designer. For one who never left Italy and whose reputation depends on a small number of built works and the repeated publication and translation of a single book, such abiding esteem is an astonishing achievement. In this course, we will study Palladio’s splendid Veneto villas and his influential Four Books of Architecture in search of the reasons for his great prominence.\n\nIn 11S, Section 1 at 10A, Books as Art: Renaissance and Baroque Illustrated Books at Dartmouth. This class examines rare illustrated books in the rich collection in Dartmouth’s Rauner Library. We will focus on the necessity or effectiveness of book illustration, the relation between text and image, book illustrations as works of art and as conveyors of knowledge. Students will study first-hand rare atlases, natural histories, medical books, minuscule prayer books, and illustrated volumes of Cervantes, Shakespeare, and Ovid. We will also take up the subject of bibliophiles and bibliomania.\n\nIn 11S, Section 2 at 2, Abstract Expressionism. Abstract Expressionism, the first American artistic movement to gain international recognition, embodied many conflicts and paradoxes. Steeping themselves in earlier European modernism, the artists nonetheless pursued a style that was to be a-historical in its immediacy. They aimed to address the most profound questions of civilization solely through acts of spontaneity. Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine Pollock, Gorky, DeKooning, Rothko, and others amidst the complexities of American culture of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.\n\nIn 11F, Mexican Muralism (identical to Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies 48). This survey course introduces students to Mexican muralism.  Students will learn about the fresco technique and how to visually analyze a mural.  We will consider the following themes: cultural nationalism; art and class politics; the legacy of muralism in the US; the ethics of aesthetic indigenism; and the gender politics of public art. Student projects will concentrate of Jose Clemente Orozco’s mural at Dartmouth College. \n\nIn 12S, The Blue Rider Group. The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) was an international group of expressionists whose work was centered in Munich, around 1912. The class will study the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky, Gabriele Münter, Franz Marc, August Macke, and Paul Klee; the group’s exhibitions; and the wide-ranging theoretical statements they published in fin-de-siècle, pre-war Munich. ",

     "In 11W, The Classical Revival in Europe and America (pending faculty approval). This course explores the classical revival in painting, sculpture, and architecture of the mid-eighteenth through early nineteenth centuries in Europe and America. The “noble simplicity and quiet grandeur” of the classical style rejected aristocratic Rococo taste in the context of political and social change. Issues include the Grand Tour, the French and American Revolutions, the aesthetic of power, utopian politics, the beautiful and the picturesque. Artists include David, Canova, Adam, Reynolds, Jefferson, and others.\n\nIn 11S, Section 1 at 11, Michelangelo. Michelangelo Buonarroti, called “Il Divino” in his own lifetime, was the dominant practitioner of painting, sculpture and architecture in sixteenth-century Italy. This course will focus on Michelangelo’s most famous creations in the light of recent restorations and new scholarship. Finally, we will look at the intersection of his visual works with his biography: how these works relate to Michelangelo’s creation of his own image, chiefly through the works of his biographers Vasari and Condivi.\n\nIn 11S, Section 2 at 12, The Archaeology of Israel: from Prehistory to the Roman Period (Identical to, and described under, Jewish Studies 41.1).\n\nIn 11X, Sculpture (pending faculty approval). This course offers a thematic approach to three-dimensional art by focusing on major works from the Renaissance to contemporary media and installation art (including sound and light), emphasizing the development of “modern” sculpture. Discussion will address cultural contexts, major theoretical concerns, close visual analysis and critical concerns about materiality, display, reception, and meaning of the plastic arts. We will visit the Hood Museum, Saint Gaudens National Historic Site, and Dartmouth campus’s outdoor sculptures. No prerequisites.",

     "This course teaches the fundamentals of clinical biomedical research (CBR). The CBR curriculum offers a unique combination of direct involvement in ongoing clinical research studies with a comprehensive didactic program and experience conducting and designing clinical studies. Designated as Academic Associates, the students will spend time in the DHMC Emergency Department (E.D.) playing an integral role in patient identification, enrollment, and data collection for the ongoing clinical research studies. Coupled with this “hands-on” data collection in the E.D., the didactic program consists of weekly classes focusing on research design, data collection techniques, statistical analysis, and scientific poster preparation. At the completion of the course, each student will develop a “mock clinical research study”.\n\nPrerequisites: Biology 12 and 13 and permission of the instructor.

     "Biology, like all of science, is a problem-solving endeavor. This course introduces students to a major problem in biology and considers it from many different perspectives, viewpoints and biological levels of organization. Along the way, students are exposed to many of the major concepts in biology, from molecules to ecosystems. Each offering will address a different major problem.\n\nOpen to all students without prerequisite.\n\nIn 10F at 9L, DNA to Disease. Genetic variation underlies much of the diseases that afflict us, but how do differences at the level of DNA translate into differences in health? How can we find genes underlying such disorders? In “DNA to Disease” we will focus on a small number of human genetic diseases, some of which are caused by defects in a single gene while others result from defects in multiple genes. Our analysis of these diseases will span from the molecular level to the population level. We will explore how genes and proteins function in cells, how cells communicate, and how these molecular and cellular mechanisms become defective in human disease. We will investigate how mutations arise, how disease alleles behave in populations, and how physicians and geneticists are exploiting human genetic variation to map the genetic bases of disease. Over the course of the term, students should gain a perspective on the diverse toolkit available to study problems in human genetics. Jack, Kern\n\nIn 10F at 10A, Biology in the News. Biology is relevant to almost all aspects of everyday life.  Some are obvious.  Everyone recognizes that medicine and agriculture clearly have their roots in biology.  However, others are not so obvious to the average person.  Even insurance actuarials, economic policies and nuclear proliferation have their roots in biology.  Each day we will consider the biological underpinnings and implications of a local, national or international news story taken from a broad range of topics.  McClung, McPeek. \n\nIn 11W at 10A,  LUCA: the Last Universal Common Ancestor. Over the course of the last 4.5 billion years, life has faced a number of challenges, and in response has evolved a number of remarkable innovations to meet those challenges. Incorporating data and perspectives from molecular and cellular biology, macroevolutionary theory, and paleobiology, we will reconstruct the biology of the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all living organisms. Her name is LUCA and unraveling her biology will require us to work within the framework of what it means to be a living cell. We will move forward in time from the origin of life, and backward in time from the remarkable diversity of life present today. We will see that much of LUCA’s biology has left “molecular fossils” in our very own DNA, and we will learn how to read this remarkable fossil record. Peterson, Sloboda.\n\nIn 11S at 9L, Emerging Infectious Diseases: How Microbes Rule the World. Emerging infectious diseases, which have shaped the course of humanity and caused untold suffering and death, will continue to challenge society as long as humans and microbes co-exist. This course will explore why infectious diseases emerge and re-emerge. The viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes that cause these diseases continually evolve in response to their hosts. Dynamic interactions between rapidly evolving infectious agents and changes in the environment and in host behavior provide such agents with favorable new ecological niches. In addition, dramatic increases in the worldwide movement of people and goods drive the globalization of disease. Guerinot, B.",

Biology 56 is a continuation of Biology 55; these courses comprise the first two-thirds of the FSP, and focus on land (tropical forests) and tropical freshwater ecosystems in Costa Rica. Biology 57 focuses on coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean. Students are challenged to know, understand and appreciate the diversity of form and function in organisms, and the interactions that generate the often-spectacular patterns they see in the field. Habitats in Costa Rica include lowland rain forest, cloud forest, dry forest, montane forest, alpine paramo, streams and wetlands. The schedule is full, including fieldwork, laboratories, lectures and discussions, with emphasis on original research, mostly in small groups of 2-3. Faculty and advanced graduate TAs share field accommodations with students, and are in continuous contact as mentors, day and evening, throughout the program. Students master field and analytical methods (including hypothesis testing, statistical and software skills) for observational and experimental research. We pursue a great variety of research topics, including plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions, processes driving coral reef structure (and coral reef decline), determinants of species distributions, animal behavior, and conservation ecology. Students practice the classic scientific approach: making observations, asking testable questions, generating hypotheses, developing experimental protocols, collecting data, making statistical inferences, writing scientific papers, and presenting seminars. Research papers are published in an annual book. Accommodations are at field stations in Costa Rica, and at a marine laboratory in the Caribbean.\n\nPrerequisites: Biology 16, one course from among Biology 20-28, 31; acceptance into program, Biology 15 and 29 recommended.",

Whether Diomedes’ rout of Aphrodite, Achilles’ struggle against the river Xanthus, Capaneus’ testing of the gods, or Hannibal’s threat to Jupiter, classical literature has frequently taken theomachy (“god-fight”) to be a central theme—a preoccupation continued in Christian epic of the Renaissance and seen even today in the bestselling novels of Philip Pullman. Concentrating on theomachic scenes in selected readings in translation, we will grapple with issues as varied as human free will, the nature of divinity, the complexities of martial force, the fragility of political legitimacy, and the power and limitations of artistic expression.

Discussion focuses on how ancient Italic traditions were transformed to suit the needs of the Imperial government (for example, the adaptation of the Republican, Hellenized Domus to the Imperial Palatia). The most dramatic change in religious practice is the development of the Imperial cult. Site analysis will stress the need for an imperial idiom, the accommodation of urban masses and the promotion of a sense of a shared cultural experience.

Among these technologies are in vitro fertilization (IVF), sperm, egg and embryo donation or freezing, surrogate motherhood, intracytoplasmic sperm insertion (ICSI) for male factor infertility, and, perhaps in the near future, cloning. Drawing on ethical, religious or feminist perspectives, some have questioned the appropriateness of using these technologies. The issues/questions we will examine include the following: What is meant by “infertility”? What are appropriate ways of responding to it? What is the status of the embryos that are routinely manipulated (frozen, biopsied or destroyed) in this context? How are we to assess new approaches to resolving infertility, such as the use of donor eggs or surrogate parenting? Who should have access to these technologies and who should pay for them? What is the status of research on egg freezing, and how might its routine accomplishment change our society? Course requirements include a research paper utilizing the interdisciplinary approach on which the course is based. R. Green, Cramer.",

     "We are bombarded with argument everywhere we look. Whether it’s at a rally for health care reform or flipping through images in a magazine, we are 24-hour recipients of messages trying to persuade us to do, buy, act, and believe. Those who use these tools of persuasion wield enormous power, power that must be used responsibly. But what are the ethical bounds of argument? If the end goal is “just,” does it really matter if evidence is “adjusted”in the process of persuasion? Does it matter if a “fact” is wrong, if the ultimate point is true? Can there sometime be a “Truth” that belies all evidence? How does one argue for or against such “Truths?”\n\nThe course is designed for students planning for a career in leadership, government, public policy, or any field in which persuading others is vital to success. The course uses the law’s Federal Rules of Evidence as a grounding document from which we will try to tease out the elements of effective argument, as well as one community’s collective “Ethic of Argument.” Other course materials draw from ethics, literature, history, popular culture, comparative law, courtroom trials, politics, and public policy. Students will apply these principles in a variety of writing and multi-media formats, as they complete, as groups, comprehensive public policy portfolios, advancing a policy issue of their choosing.",

     "Harold Pinter, John Patrick Shanley, David Mamet, Neil Labute, Susan-Lori Parks, Arthur Miller, Tom Stoppard – these are just a few of the significant playwrights of the latter half of the twentieth century (and the early part of the 21st) who have done significant work, in some cases their best, in film. This course is a workshop where the student will have the opportunity to tell the same story in both forms, as a play and a film script, and determine in which way the story is most effectively told. After starting the course with an exploration of the screenplay’s origins as the filmed version of the “well-made play,” and then traveling through to the modern day when the screenplay has developed its own form and structure, we will use what we’ve learned about the history and its master practitioners to develop and present story ideas, to make a choice of a specific story, and to write and present both first and final drafts of that same story as both a play and a screenplay. We will then have a public reading of one form or the other – the student will be given the opportunity to choose – in a final presentation at the end of the term.",

     "The idea that the city and the self are intertwined is not new; nor is the idea that theater and art provide special channels of access to the human mind, ones that bypass reason in shaping experience. In the Republic, for instance, Plato considers how in crafting cities and myths, we may design better human beings, or worse ones, creating them from without and within. The advent of new materials, new technologies and new media forms brought these ancient concerns vividly to life as well for artists and architects in the early twentieth century. What is the role of a building or a city in shaping human experience? How should we think about the role of motion pictures and electronic media in constructing and framing human experience? What might these mean for an individual’s conception of self and identity? This course is a study of some key ideas about the designed environment and the individual in modernity, particularly as they arise and are expressed in the “modernist” movements in architecture and cinema in the first half of the twentieth century and with additional attention to the way as in which the same issues play forward to today. Readings and media texts from philosophy, architecture, film, and media studies.",

Finally, we turn to the problem of the identity of the Bronze Age Trojans and the circumstances of the legendary war they fought against the Mycenaean Greeks on the northwestern border of the Hittite Empire.",

     "Particular offerings of this course seek to introduce the student to the aims, assumptions and methodologies of reading and the study of literature. This course is designed as an introductory course to the Comparative Literature major and other literature and humanities majors. It is recommended that students complete English/Writing 5 before enrolling in Comparative Literature 10.\n\nIn 11W, 12S Border Crossings: Exile, Expatriation and Immigration. This course will examine the experiences of exile and immigration through the art, literature and films of men and women who have left their homelands or who were born in exile and immigration. In addition to such authors as Homer, Joyce and Eva Hoffman, we will read Caribbean, Asian-American, Arab-American, Turkish-German, Black British and Afro-French writers. We will address questions of identity and alterity (belonging vs. ‘unbelonging,’ home vs. exile, assimilation vs. hybridization), and we will explore such concepts as diaspora, migrancy, transmigration, displacement, nomadism and home.\n\nIn 11S, Lying and Truth Telling in Literature. This course will consider stories about lies, oaths, promises, the duty to speak up, the duty to remain silent, as well as the question what sort of “truthfulness” literature may have, or do without. Readings may include selections from the Bible, a variety of folk tales, and works by Plato, Lucian of Samosate, Gottfried von Strassburg, Montaigne, Sidney, Shakespeare, Twain, Wilde, Sartre, Atwood, and others.\n\nIn 11F, Male Friendship from Aristotle to Almodovar. This course examines representations of male relationships in literature, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and film. Ranging from classical texts such as the Bible and Cicero’s “De Amicitia,” to the cinema of Almodovar and Truffaut, we will study the rhetorical and social construction of male friendship and its relationship to gender, class and cultural politics. Texts will be drawn from the following literary and critical works: Aristotle, Martial, Montaigne, Balzac, Twain, Whitman, Nietzche, Freud, D.H. Lawrence, Waugh, Ben Jalloun, Alan Bennett, and Derrida.\n\nIn 12W, The Odyssey and Odyssean Spin-Offs. This course is organized around the subject of traveling and homecoming. We will read the epic attributed to “Homer” in its entirety; a series of poems by Tennyson, Cavafy, Pound, and Seferis; James Joyce’s Ulysses; excerpts from Kazantzakis’s Odyssey: A Modern Sequel; Christa Wolf’s Cassandra; Derek Walcott’s Omeros; and Botho Strauss’s drama Ithaka. Is there such a thing as a universal theme? How might genre, author’s gender, culture, or historical period inflect a similar theme? What criteria have been used in specific periods to label a literary work a “classic”? What criteria are used by our culture and by us individually to evaluate the worth of a piece of literature?",

Cheese, kitsch, camp, corn, trash – all of these terms refer to easily recognized objects and phenomena, yet the theorization of how and why these modes of labeling are so important and widespread in diverse cultures has rarely been undertaken. Which critical theories seem appropriate to the study of a body of artifacts ranging from the Parisian panoramas examined by Walter Benjamin, to kitsch art and camp spectacles, to the wrestlers and detergent brands of Barthes’s Mythologies, to Lady Gaga, YouTube, and American Idol? The focus of this course will be upon the interactions between the production of “artworks” as commodities and the interpellation of individuals as subjects who purchase or adopt these works as integral parts of their social identities.",

This course studies literary and dramatic representations of women of the Asian diaspora, ranging from authors in North America, Canada, Australia, and Europe to Southeast Asia. It examines the ways in which migration, dislocation and resettlement have influenced identity formation and cultural production for women of Asian descent. We will look at the impact of global versus local imperatives and feminist responses to the tensions between these and other historical forces. Authors may include: Yoko Ono (Japan/USA), Catherine Lim (Singapore), Beth Yahp (Australia), Jessica Hagedorn (Philippines/USA), Chuah Guat Eng (Malaysia), Sky Lee (Canada), Wendy Law-Yone (Burma), Monica Ali (U.K.).\n\nIn 11S, Gender and Islam (Identical to International Studies 17 and Women’s and Gender Studies 50.2). While the European novel takes a notoriously orientalizing view of the exotic, often veiled, Muslim woman, in the hands of Muslim writers the novel has become a site for contestation of traditional gender definitions, even reinterpretation of legal and religious texts.

During the 1930s and 1940s, hundreds of German-speaking film professionals lived and worked in Hollywood, among them Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Peter Lorre, and Marlene Dietrich. In this course we study how the exiles’ sense of identity in the United States was shaped by the experience of displacement and the fight against fascism. We will also investigate how exile cinema intervenes in public debates, and how it reframes political issues in terms of narrative and images.\n\nIn 12S, Film as Poetry: The Avant Garde (Identical to Film and Media Studies 41). The cinematic avant garde is to film what poetry is to prose, a demand to read differently. Topics to be explored include the relation of poetry and film to history, the family, gender and sexuality, visual arts such as painting, photography, and book arts, and different ways to think about formal experimentation.",

     "Covering some of the major theoretical movements of the second half of the twentieth century, this course focuses on the issues and questions motivating theoretical debate in literary and cultural studies. Movements studied may include New Criticism, structuralism, semiotics, poststructuralism and deconstruction, Marxist criticism, psychoanalysis, narratology, reader-response theory, feminist criticism, African American criticism, film criticism, and the new historicism.\n\nIn 10F, What is Theory? Since the beginnings of the 20th Century, critical theory has slowly transformed the study of literature. Although most scholars who study literary texts now use theory in one way or another, few would be able to define the discipline. This course will examine some of the major texts in the field, including the roots of contemporary critical practices in philosophy, linguistics, and semiotics, as well as some of the latest, “cutting edge” applications of theory to all kinds of cultural “objects”: texts, films, clothes, bodies, genders, identities, buildings, cities, nations, etc. Works by Saussure, Jakobson, Foucault, Lacan, Benjamin, Derrida, Hegel, Butler, Venturi, Kohlhaas and others.\n\nIn 11F, Literary Theory: Entering the Conversation. Disparate theories of literature have shared a certain number of fundamental questions since long before the twentieth century: what is a text? what is an author? what is a reader? what is context? How does literature itself imply theoretical concepts? By studying a range of different answers, we will seek to formulate productive questions. How can we use these questions to join critical conversations already under way among established scholars? Warren.",

The Workshop in Critical Writing introduces graduate students to advanced research techniques, to the conventions of scholarly discourse, and to the various kinds of writing practiced in literary studies. We will analyze scholarly articles as examples of research methods, argument development, rhetorical technique, and stylistic presentation; we will test a variety of practical approaches to the interpretation of literary texts; and we will explore how we might use theory in critical argument. Students will be asked to prepare and submit a scholarly article using previous written work of their own (senior thesis, independent study project) as a basis.

     "Planning, scheduling, and design problems in large organizations, economic or engineering systems can often be modeled mathematically using variables satisfying linear equations and inequalities. This course explores these models: the types of problems that can be handled, their formulation, solution, and interpretation. It introduces the theory underlying linear programming, a natural extension of linear algebra that captures these types of models, and also studies the process of modeling concrete problems, the algorithms to solve these models, and the solution and analysis of these problems using a modeling language. It also discusses the relation of linear programming to the more complex frameworks of nonlinear programming and integer programming. These paradigms broaden linear programming to respectively allow for nonlinear equations and inequalities, or for variables to be constrained to be integers.\n\nPrerequisites: Computer Science 3, 8, or 19; Mathematics 8; Mathematics 22 or 24; or permission of the instructor.",

These principles enable us to understand weather systems and associated fronts, clouds, winds, and precipitation, and to forecast weather using simple visual observations, satellite data and supercomputers. They are also the basis for the global circulation of air, energy and water, as well as the restlessly changing, diverse climate zones of our planet. Labs will provide hands-on experience observing the weather, building and using simple meteorological instruments, interpreting network data and satellite images, and forecasting the weather in real time.

General equilibrium models are developed to analyze the determinants of GNP, unemployment, the rate of inflation, and the growth of output. The micro foundations of macro aggregates are developed, with special emphasis on the role of expectations. The analytic tools are used to evaluate monetary and fiscal policies and to understand current macroeconomic controversies.\n\nPrerequisites: Mathematics 3 and Economics 1.",

Yet the breakneck speed and seemingly “effortless” way that young children acquire language remain its most miraculous characteristic. We will discover the biological capacities and the important social, family, and educational factors that, taken together, make this feat possible and establish the basic facts of language acquisition, involving children’s babbling, phonology, early vocabulary, morphology, syntax, semantics, and discourse knowledge, as well as their early gestural and pragmatic competence. Prevailing theoretical explanations and research methods will be explored. We will dispel the myths of how bilingual children acquire two languages from birth. We will leave our hearing-speaking modality and explore the world of language acquisition in total silence—regarding the acquisition of natural signed languages—as an innovative lens into the factors that are most key in acquiring all language. Crucially, we will evaluate the efficacy of how language is presently taught to young children in schools in light of the facts of human language acquisition.\n\nOpen to all classes.",

How can we use what we know about the brain to inform the way in which we teach children and develop educational programs? This seminar seeks to critically discuss these questions by comparing and contrasting the way in which development is construed across multiple disciplines (education, neuroscience, psychology). We will critically evaluate what convergences and divergences exist across these disciplines that might be exploited to gain new insights into aspects of cognitive development that are critical to educating children in schools (such as thinking, learning, knowledge and skill acquisition). This will enable a discussion of how such an integrative approach may help to structure better educational programs for typically developing children and intervention programs for children with atypical development.\n\nPrerequisite: permission of the Department.",

Beginning with Matthew Arnold and Oscar Wilde as dynastic founders, we will examine the work and influence of, among others, T.S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, William Empson, F.R. Leavis, Cleanth Brooks, Northrop Frye, Paul de Man, Harold Bloom, Stanley Fish, Barbara Johnson, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Edward Said, and Judith Butler. An intellectual history in itself, the story of modern criticism is also a story of changing terms, concepts, and critical practices, many of which continue to shape our ways of understanding literary and other texts.

     "The “invention” of America changed the world forever and precipitated the beginning of the modern era. This course explores that invention, covering the period of about 1500 to 1800 and surveying a wide range of cultural attitudes towards the imagination, exploration, and settlement of the Americas: Native American, Spanish, French, and English. Our reading, including oral tales, letters, diaries, captivity narratives, poetry, personal narratives, political tracts, and secondary criticism, will focus on the themes of conquest, captivity, cannibalism in the shaping of a particularly “American” identity. We will use historical sources and early books and manuscripts to illuminate attitudes towards power, identity, race, gender, and nature prevailing in the multicultural landscape of the early Americas that shaped the emerging literature and culture of British North America. We will also look at recent cinematic representations of this early period in our examination of the shifting and contentious meaning of “America.”",

Readings may include works by Bradstreet, Taylor, Wheatley, Emerson, Poe, Whitman, Dickinson, Melville and Dunbar. We may also study Native American poetry and schools like the Fireside Poets, 19th-century women poets, and precursors of early Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance. We will look at lyric, meditative, religious, comic and political poetry, the long poem and the epic. Some themes we might trace include the transatlantic character of American poetry, its “newness,” its engagement with religion and self-definition, with nature, and with gender and race. Emphasizing close readings as well as historical and cultural contexts, this course examines the complexities of an American poetic vision and serves as an introduction to reading poetry and to American literature.",

The course is designed to provide an overview of the literary history of the United States novel from the National Period to the threshold of the Modern (1845-1900). To do justice to the range of works under discussion, the lectures will call attention to the heterogeneous cultural contexts out of which these works have emerged as well as the formal and structural components of the different works under discussion. In keeping with this intention, the lectures include the so-called classic texts in American literature The Last of the Mohicans, Moby Dick, The Scarlet Letter, The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, but also the newly canonized Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Life in the Iron Mills, Hope Leslie in the hope that the configuration of these works will result in an understanding of the remarkable complexity of United States literary culture.",

     "In 11W at 10 (section 1), Native American Oral Traditional Literature (Identical to, and described under, Native American Studies 34).\n\nIn 11W at 12 (section 2), History of the Book (Identical to Comparative Literature 40). This course examines the book as a material and cultural object. We’ll consider various practical and theoretical models for understanding the book form and investigating the materials, technologies, institutions, and practices of its production, dissemination, and reception. We’ll focus primarily on the printed book in Western Europe and North America, but we’ll also spend time talking about the emergence of the codex (book), medieval manuscript books, twentieth and twenty-first century artist’s books and the challenges posed by digitality to the book form. The readings for the course will be balanced by frequent use of exemplars drawn from Rauner Library and practical experience in the Book Arts workshop setting type.\n\nIn 11W at 2A (section 3), Evidence of Things Not Seen: Advanced Creative Nonfiction. Through close readings of creative nonfiction, we’ll investigate craft—character, voice, structure, and sequence—as well as parable, myth, and allusion, the intangible “facts” at the heart of the genre. We’ll conduct our inquiry through excursions into faith, doubt, and the territory in between. Our goal is to learn how to inhabit the ideas and experience of “belief,” broadly defined, an essential step in writing nonfiction stories that transcend their journalistic foundations.\n\nIn 11W at 2 (section 4), The Poetics of Literary Practice. Designed for students interested in the intersections of literary study, theory, and the practice of creative writing, this course explores how modern and contemporary poets have thought about their own art. How do underlying theories about language, art, culture, and history inform a poet’s literary practice? Students will develop their own creative and critical writing practices, participate in workshop critique, compose responses to the selected readings, and complete an essay that explores their own poetics.\n\nIn 11W at 10A (section 5), Some Elements of Drama. Traversing ten plays and a range of critical responses to theater and performance, the course entertains questions concerning the purpose of theater, the fascination and anxiety it occasions, and the complex dynamics among players, playgoers and playtexts, exploring what drama does for—and to—audiences. A playlist including Sophocles and Shakespeare, but also Beckett, Pirandello, Pinter and Churchill, challenges and expands upon issues raised by theorists from Plato’s time to the present.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 6), Writers at Work. This course will explore how cultural stories shape the identities of writers and inform their work. We will read writers on their writing process, looking at how their contexts inform and shape their stories. We will read and discuss such writers as: Toni Morrison, J.D. Salinger, T. Olsen, W. Faulkner, and T.T. Williams. The overarching goal of the course will be to help students to develop a concrete writing process, gaining voice and self-consciousness within their own cultural stories. Students will be encouraged to write not only about other writers’ writing process but about their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 7), The Poem in Context. A noted American writer allegedly boasted, “I don’t read books; I write them.” This course is for another kind of writer, the kind who ponders questions such as: what happens in a poem? why do some move us so intensely that we learn them by heart? how do they change the way we think? As we write and read 20th century poems, we will reflect on the assumptions that shape them and will examine their historical and social contexts. As we write and read theory and criticism, we will try to make the practical and theoretical aspects of the art cohere.",

     "In 11W at 10A (section 1), Digital Game Studies. This course explores digital gaming. Reading academic and popular texts, we will situate digital gaming in relation to new media, visual, and literary studies. Class discussion will focus on problems in digital game studies: Where do the histories of technology and gaming meet? How do games change players and shape culture? This class will also study particular games, and, in addition to writing essays, students will invent individual and group projects in the game domain.\n\nIn 11S at 2 (section 2), National Allegory: Readings in Postcolonial Literature and Culture (Identical to Comparative Literature 49). This course explores current theories of nationalism and postnationalism and how these theories could be productively utilized in making sense of literary texts from the postcolonial world. Authors include Lu Xun from China; Raja Rao from India; Sembene Ousmane from Senegal; Ngugi wa Thiong’o from Kenya; and Chinua Achebe from Nigeria. Cultural theorists whose work will be discussed include Ernest Renan, Benedict Anderson, Homi Bhabha, Partha Chatterjee, Franz Fanon, and Frederic Jameson, among others.",

     "In 11W at 2A (section 1), Shakespeare as an Acting Script (Identical to Theater 10). Patrick Stewart once said that even a small part in Shakespeare is hugely rewarding for an actor because, in Shakespeare, even the lowliest messenger has been given a ‘personality’ that lies right there in the language, waiting for the actor to give it life. This course will examine each of two plays as an actor’s script. The class should be attractive both to students who just enjoy drama and to those specifically interested in performing, directing, or writing plays.\n\nIn 11W at 10 (section 2), 1611. We’ll read what someone attentive to the literary and socio-political networks of England in 1611 might have read or seen performed, including plays and poems by Shakespeare, Jonson, Donne, and Middleton, prose pamphlets, civic and courtly entertainments, contemporary letters and manuscript treatises. We’ll focus primarily on work published or circulated between 1609 and 1612. Discussion, short papers and oral presentations, term paper.",

Their childhood in Haworth, the intensity of their novels, the relationship with their father and brother—all have been fodder for literary and biographical analysis, and spawned an entire industry of memorabilia, imitation and criticism. In the seminar we will do close readings of four Brontë novels (Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Villette, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall), and critical articles, look at some of their juvenilia, and read Lucasta Miller’s The Brontë Myth. We’ll end with Maryse Conde’s Windward Heights and Jasper Fforde’s imaginative novel The Eyre Affair. We will also view 2-3 film adaptations of their novels.",

     "In 10F at 10A (section 1), Contemporary American Poetry. This course concentrates on American poetry since 1960. We will consider the influence of the “schools” of poetry which evolved in the second half of the twentieth century, including the Beats, the New York poets, the Confessional poets, the Black Mountain School, the New Romantics, and the New Formalists. Our primary focus will be to examine a variety of poets through close readings of individual poems. Paying close attention to the crafting of the poem, we will discuss key aspects such as voice, tone, image, metaphor, and the nature of the line. Poets we will study include Ginsberg, Lowell, O’Hara, Bishop, Plath, Kunitz, Hayden, James Wright, Brooks, Levine, Levertov, and Rich. Creative Writing majors are encouraged to take this course.\n\nIn 10F at 2A (section 8), Transforming Narrative (Identical to Women’s and Gender Studies 59.2). We define and transform ourselves through stories. In this community-based learning course, students will alternate studying narratives of prison, addiction, and recovery in the traditional classroom with travel to Valley Vista, a substance abuse rehabilitation center in Bradford, Vermont, where they will participate in a program for women patients whose goal is the creation and performance of an original production that will facilitate the patients’ voices. Written work for the course will combine critical analysis and self-reflection.\n\nIn 11W at 11 (section 3), Indian Killers: Murder and Mystery in Native Literature and Film (Identical to, and described under, Native American Studies 32).\n\nIn 11S at 11 (section 4), Woolfenstein (Identical to WGST 53). In her well known passage from A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf stated that “we think back through our mothers if we are women”; twenty years later, Gertrude Stein would obliquely refer to herself as “the mother of us all.” These two women occupy a central place in European and American modernism, their work having influenced successive generations of writers. Using a series of thematic and theoretical frameworks, we will explore the intersections between the two, asking how they staged their resistances to traditional/patriarchal literary and cultural structures. Possible frameworks are gender and genre; queer texts and contexts; war, nation, and gender; class, ethnicity, and authority; iconization. Texts by Woolf might include Jacob’s Room, Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, and Between the Acts; texts by Stein might include Ida, Three Lives, Everybody’s Autobiography, and Mrs. Reynolds. We will also be reading a selection of critical and/or feminist theory. Suggested background courses are English 15, Comparative Literature 72, WGST 16.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 5), African Literatures: Masterpieces of Literature From Africa (Identical to African and African American Studies 51 and Comparative Literature 51. Described under Comparative Literature 51).\n\nIn 11S at 2A (section 9), Faulkner. In this course we will read five of Faulkner’s novels, The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Absalom, Absalom, Light in August, and The Hamlet. Our focus will be on Faulkner’s continuing attention to constructions of identity: especially Southern identities, racialized identities, and individual psyches. We will spend considerable time reading criticism, by such writers as Edouard Glissant and Vera Kutzinski.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 10), The Black Arts Movement. This course explores the literature, art, and criticism of the Black Arts Movement. The artistic corollary to the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as artists/activists sought to put a revolutionary cultural politics into practice. The movement had far-reaching implications for the way we think about race, history, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. Readings include Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and other.\n\nSeminars are designed as small courses, limited to twelve students, primarily seniors; qualified juniors may enroll. These courses emphasize discussion, and allow the student to develop his or her thinking about a subject throughout the term. Though assignments vary according to the nature of the material being studied, seminars usually involve class presentations and a term paper. They fulfill the “Culminating Experience” requirement. Prerequisite: at least four completed major courses, of which one must be in the same course group as the seminar. Students who successfully complete a seminar may sometimes be allowed to follow it with a one-term Honors project (see the section on Honors, above).",

     "In 10F at 2A (section 1), Shakespeare’s History Plays and the Making of England. England first emerges as a nation-state under the Tudor monarchs, and Shakespeare’s creation and dissemination of the myths of origin within his history plays was crucial in enabling people to imagine a shared “Englishness.” We will focus on the 8 plays that span the approximate 75 year Wars of the Roses, running from the deposition of Richard II to the fall of Richard III and the ascendancy of the first Tudor monarch, Henry VII.\n\nIn 11W at 2A (section 2), Medieval Animals. From bestiary collections to theological tracts, from scholastic debates between birds to trickster heroes such as Reynard the fox, medieval literature is full of meaningful animals. This course will examine the significance of a variety of medieval “animal” texts, ranging from The Book of Beasts and the Physiologus to Marie de France’s Fables and Chaucer’s The Nun’s Priest’s Tale. We will also consider recent theoretical studies of the “animal” in culture as well as corollary American critters such as Coyote and the Signifying Monkey.\n\nIn 11S at 2A (section 3), Thomas Middleton: Dramatist. Middleton was one of the most prolific and brilliant dramatists of the seventeenth century, writing concurrently with Shakespeare and Jonson. A consummate professional, he wrote with equal distinction in tragedy (The Revenger’s Tragedy, The Changeling, Women Beware Women), comedy (A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, The Roaring Girl), satires and masques. Middleton’s career is fascinating study in the history and conditions of seventeenth century performance, solo and collaborative authorship, and dramatic styles. We will see that Shakespeare was by no means the only kid on the block.",

     "In 10F at 11 (section 1), American Naturalism: Machines, Money and Madness. Novels of American Naturalism by such authors as Theodor Dreiser and Frank Norris are marked by a tragic vision, more seedy than heroic. The sensational violence in these works suggests a deterministic universe populated by atavistic, avaricious actors poised for destruction. This class explores Naturalism’s key texts and contexts in works by Dreiser, Norris, Stephen Crane, Charles Chesnutt, Edith Wharton, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Ellen Glasgow, Jack London, John Steinbeck, and Richard Wright.\n\nIn 10F at 12 (section 2), Bohemia and the 19th Century Novel. By the 1890s, the figure of the Bohemian had become central to a cosmopolitan literary culture eager to assert its autonomy from the marketplace and a restrictive notion of Englishness. It also evoked a range of anxieties bound up with cultural decadence, racial degeneration, transgressive sexuality and the occult. This course will study a series of novels that foreground these issues, including major texts by Oscar Wilde, George Gissing, Marie Corelli, and Joseph Conrad.",

After some discussion of Joyce’s Portrait and Dubliners—both of which students are urged to read before the course begins—we will focus on the text of Joyce’s Ulysses, with an emphasis on close reading and an examination of Joyce’s experiments in prose and his place in modern literature. Each student will be asked to write two papers.\n\nIn 11S at 2A (section 1), Science, Fiction and Empire. This course investigates how scientific knowledge production contributes to powerful narratives we tell about the body, gender, race, and sexuality, for example. Students critically examine a number of science fiction novels, short stories, and films as well as a broader set of scientific fictions pulled from popular and institutional media. We also explore the historical relationships between science and imperialism, exploration and discovery, conquest and the mining of natural resources. Engaging with postcolonial, feminist, and queer theory, students also read in the field of science studies.\n\nIn 11S at 10A (section 2), Toni Morrison This course is an intensive study of Toni Morrison’s major fictional works. We will also read critical responses by and about the author. Required texts may include Sula, Song of Solomon, Beloved, Jazz, Paradise, Playing in the Dark, and critical contributions by writers such as Barbara Smith and Paul Gilroy. Some of the central issues we will examine include alternative constructions of female community and genealogy, and representations of race, class, nationhood and identity.",

The purpose of English 92, when taken in Glasgow, is to enhance the experience of studying English and Scottish literature in a global, and more specifically British, context. The requirement may be fulfilled in one of three ways: by taking a course devoted to the study of European literature or the history of the English language; by taking a course in a field clearly relevant to the study of literature in English (e.g., history, art history, philosophy, media studies); by taking a course that immerses the student in some aspect of Scottish, British, or Celtic language, literature, culture or history. This course must be approved by the program director. On the Trinidad FSP, this will be a course of study in West Indian history and culture. On the Dublin FSP, this will be a course of study in the English Department at Trinity College Dublin (TCD). Of the three courses at TCD at least one must be in Irish literature.

     "A very significant part of designing electronic instruments involves selecting the appropriate physical devices to translate quantities to be measured into voltages or currents that can be sensed with electronic circuits. The range of sensors and transducers available will be studied with examples from industry and medical instrumentation. The course will explore in some detail the use of analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) converters and their applications. Students will also learn to use complete A/D-microprocessor-D/A systems since these are part of nearly all instruments now. In this course students will learn to build a complete instrument by combining analog and digital components and using advanced algorithms. We will review the basic concepts from analog electronics and real-time event driven programming one needs to understand in order to construct such instruments and experiment through a series of labs. The course will culminate with group projects to induce the students to go through the design process on a problem of their choice.\n\nPrerequisite: Engineering Sciences 31 and 61 or equivalent.",

Others may seek to apply by permission.\n\nIn 10F at 10A, Simulation for Sustainability. Gauging the impacts of our current actions on future generations is a critical but difficult element of sustainability science. In this class we will learn about the different ways that scientists have used computers to generate simulations of human-environment interactions and explore the long run effects of human choices. Students will also have a chance to create and analyze their own simple simulations of human-environment interactions using a program called Netlogo.\n\nPrerequisites Environmental Studies 20, 55, or 56.\n\nIn 11S, Arrange, Polar Science, Policy, and Ethics (Identical to Biological Sciences 148).This course examines the connections between polar science and the human dimensions of rapid environmental change in the Arctic. The differing ways of understanding environmental change from the standpoints of western science and traditional knowledge information will be viewed as drivers of policy formulation. The course will emphasize team learning and the development of science communication skills as an important part of the policy research process.\n\nThis is a core course in the IGERT Polar Environmental Change graduate curriculum and will include instructors from several disciplines. Open to qualified undergraduates by permission of the instructor.\n\nIn 11S at 10A, Conservation Science and Policy. This course examines the interplay of science, management, law and policy in the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources. Questions to be addressed include: What is the appropriate unit for management, the population or the ecosystem? Do charismatic species such as grizzly bears and elephants serve as useful management umbrella species or are more comprehensive objectives needed? Are national parks effective vehicles for conserving biodiversity? How thorough is the scientific basis for management?\n\nPrerequisite: Environmental Studies 2 or permission of the instructor.",

     "An examination of the concept and use of genre with focus on a particular genre. How are the genres determined and how useful structurally and historically is genre as a concept of classification? What constitutes a genre? What is the relationship between periods and genres? Between genre and the Hollywood film? This course will consider genre as both an aesthetic concept and an economic one, producing stabilization and variation in product. The roles of repetition and variation, stability and change. Genres may include the western, the crime movie, the women’s film, the musical, family melodrama, the film noir or other genre-related topics such as film and literature. May be repeated for credit with a different topic.\n\nIn 11W at 2A (Section 1), Musicals. This course examines the Hollywood musical from its beginnings in 1927 to the present. Topics include the integration of singing and dancing into narrative; the musical as social commentary; musical biographies; the use of different kinds of popular music (Tin Pan Alley, Broadway, rock, country); the death and revival of the genre from Moulin Rouge to  Sweeney Todd).\n\nIn 11W at 10A (Section 2) Men to Boys: Masculinities in Film (Identical to, and described under, WGST 56.8).\n\nIn 11X at 10A, Ethnographic Film (Identical to Anthropology 12.1). Ethnographic film crosses the boundaries of academic anthropology and popular media. This course will address the construction of meaning in ethnographic films in relation to the parallel concerns of anthropology. We will consider approaches to film style, the relation of visual media to ethnographic representation, and the challenges visual forms pose to written ethnographies. The class will appeal to anthropology and film students as well as students interested in the politics of cross-cultural representation.\n\nIn 11F at 3A, Animation History. This course is an introduction to the history and development of the field of animation from the prehistory of cinema to the present day. Surveying both commercial and artisanal forms of production and distribution, the class will repeatedly contextualize the various functions of animation under a series of cultural, economic, and formal lenses. Students should bring an enthusiastic interest in the medium and devote serious effort to reading about, viewing, researching, and discussing the works.\n\nIn 12S at 11 (Section 1) Film as Poetry: The Avant Garde (Identical to, and described under, COLT 62).\n\nIn 12S at 2A (Section 2) Visual Music. This course is an introduction to the history of the exploration of the relationship between music and (mostly) abstract imagery. We will investigate this subject from its predecessors to the current day—tracing the constantly expanding practices of visual music through painting, cinema, performance, and installation—from intuitive sketch films to complex algorithmic works. Students should bring an enthusiastic interest in the medium and devote serious effort to reading about, viewing, researching, and discussing all things visual music.",

It will include a consideration of both pre-television media (especially radio) and new media (cyber-culture) as they inform a historical understanding of TV. The norms and practices of the network era (1955-1985) will be positioned as a functional middle-ground, much in the way that classical Hollywood Cinema (1920-1960) serves as middle-ground in motion picture history. Students will be encouraged to develop their capacity for a critical distance from contemporary media via this historicized approach. Open to all classes. Limited to 50 students.",

     "This course presents a range of approaches to film studies outside traditional categories such as genre or national cinemas. Each course will emphasize a different combination of historical, theoretical, and new methodological approaches to one area of film studies.\n\nIn 11W at 10A (Section 1), Cut and Paste Cinema. Using principles of both animation and editing, this course will explore the results of combination in cut and paste cinema in conjunction with the history of collage--from classic uses in painting, photomontage, architecture, and literature to contemporary functions via mash-ups, samples, and digital manipulation. Through producing projects, screening films, discussing readings, and writing papers, we will explore the varying formulations of new meanings via the pairing of found elements.\n\nIn 11W at 3A (Section 2), Independent American Film. This course examines the emergence and growth of the American Independent film movement from post-WW II to the present day. Working outside of and sometimes subversively within the Hollywood studio system, independents crafted films of an extraordinary variety across a wide spectrum of genres and styles. Despite a production and distribution system designed to exclude them, they prevailed in creating a compelling alternative vision to Hollywood’s increasingly homogenized mass entertainment. The course seeks to analyze and contextualize what it means to be an independent filmmaker, what an independent film actually is and why it matters. Students will be involved in the actual process of independent film through meeting visiting independent filmmakers and by conceptualizing, producing and budgeting an independent film of their own.\n\nIn 11S at 10A, Handmade Strategies. This course will explore non-conventional, artisanal modes of experiments and avant-garde cinema that focus on the materiality of moving image media formats. By utilizing a variety of techniques—direct image and sound manipulation 16mm film, hand-processing, ray-o-grams, scanner animation, and live-projector performance—students will gain total-filmmaker toolsets to prepare for individual final projects that will screen publicly. In addition to producing personal projects, students will complete a series of written exercises that build upon in-class screenings, reading, and discussions to locate handmade cinema within historical and cultural contexts.\n\nIn 11X at 2A, Migration Stories. With over 50 million displaced people today, migration is one of the most compelling problems of our time. Filmic and literary representations of migration focus on borders, different types of migrants, and their border crossing experiences. We will study migration from Latin America to the U.S.; from Africa and Eastern Europe to Western Europe; and internal migration within these countries. We will also analyze how Hollywood cinema itself creates images and values that drive migration. Gemunden, Spitta.\n\nIn 11F at 10A, Jews and Hollywood. (Identical to, and described under, Jewish Studies 22.\n\nIn 12W at 10A (Section 1), History of the Hollywood Studio System. This class will look at the history of the Hollywood studio film production system, concentrating on its formation in the late teens and twenties through its greatest crises in the 1950s, and concluding with its survival as a system for television production and distribution for independent film companies from the 1950s to the present. The emergence of specific studio “styles,” the importance of the star system, the place of other creative talent in studio hierarchies and division of labor, and studios’ relations with other businesses (e.g. manufacturers of ancillary products) will be examined in the context of film and social histories of twentieth-century American culture. The course will also include a focus on the methodologies of researching the history of the studio system.\n\nIn 12W at 10A (Section 2), Found Footage. This hybrid production/studies course examines films that appropriate, quote, and re-contextualize footage from other movies. There will be weekly screenings of works by avant-garde filmmakers such as Bruce Conner and Péter Forgács, documentaries such as Night and Fog and Atomic Café, fiction features such as What’s Up Tiger Lily and Forrest Gump. In addition to screenings, readings, and papers, students will edit short films on Final Cut Pro software.",

This course surveys both the history and contemporary case studies of what is labeled “quality” television. This description spans across fiction, non-fiction, and “reality” formats, and can arise from critics, scholars, advocacy groups, or even the industry itself. As a result, the concept of “quality television” varies a great deal across history and especially within our contemporary media environment. Although our focus will be U.S. television, we will consider how the concept of “quality” is sometimes derived from comparisons with television outside the U.S. We will invite speakers who have worked in quality television and/or its histories. Students will be expected to contribute to a course blog, and write analytical papers, including a research paper.\n\nIn 12W at 11, Sound: Theory and Practice. Through the analysis of soundtracks and the creation of soundtracks, this course will explore the history of film sound and the way theories of sound reproduction continue to influence the development of sound technology and the practical choices made by sound recorders, sound mixers and editors. We will look at early sound films, 70s breakthroughs (Murch), and the imaginary soundscapes of different genres (e.g. science fiction).",

Techniques of critical reading and interpretation are studied as an approach to these topics, which reflect the interests of the teaching staff.\n\nPrerequisite: French 3, or equivalent preparation.\n\nIn 10F at 12, Amour, sexe, sexualité. Love, sex, and sexuality have generated a wide range of literary works. This course will consider a number of genres (poems, tales, tragedies, novels, memoirs, letters, films) from the sixteenth through the twenty-first centuries in order to answer several questions. How is love related to sex? Are sex and sexuality the same thing? Do desire and love have anything in common? Why are sex and love so important in literature? LaGuardia.\n\nIn 10F at 2, The Anatomy of Passion: Couples in Love. A study of passion in French and francophone literature through the ages, as seen through texts and films. Readings may include works by Sceve, Corneille, Laclos, Flaubert, Condé.\n\nIn 11W, The Joy of Literature. Reading can change desire, and redirecting desire can change the world. Reading can also introduce a degree of play into the landscape of desire and enable us to call into question the established order of things. The course studies the ways in which plays, essays, poetry and short stories can be interpreted and stimulate our desire. A writing workshop will be included to enable students to gain further mastery of French.\n\nIn 11S, Exotic Encounters: Versailles Meets the Taj Mahal. In this course we will examine the effect the contacts with the “Orient” had on France from the sixteenth to the twentieth century. We will begin with France’s contact with India and the Ottoman Empire and then extend our analysis to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will read travel narratives, correspondence, novels, theatre, and poetry by writers such as Bernier, La Fontaine, Lafayette, Racine, and Voltaire.\n\nIn 11X, Family Ties. Families shape us and our sense of life’s possibilities, even, or especially, when we strike out on our own. This course examines how French writers across the centuries have depicted their and their characters’ ties to family. Readings may include works by Corneille, Molière, Lafayette, Balzac, Hugo, Ernaux, Pagnol, and Sijie.",

     "The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a dynamic and volatile period characterized on the one hand by the rise to power of the most absolute of all monarchs, the Sun King Louis XIV, symbolized by Versailles, and on the other hand by the French Revolution. Fostered by royal patronage, literature and the arts flourished, yet many writers also used artistic expression to counter this royal power. The period saw the birth of the modern French novel and the development of a rich body of theatrical and philosophical literature. These centuries are recognized as major components of France’s collective identity and their influence is still felt in France today. Authors may include Descartes, Corneille, Racine, Molière, Lafayette, Diderot, Rousseau, Voltaire, Graffigny, Beaumarchais and Laclos.\n\nPrerequisite: French 10, or permission of the instructor.",

Genres may be defined historically: thus epic is recognized in its medieval form; tragedy receives its normative definition during classicism. Genres may also be defined formally so that narrative may be studied as it evolves across several centuries. Issues to be considered may include the way genre shapes the production and reception of literary texts and the relationship between historical and generic determinants of a given work.\n\nPrerequisite: French 10, or permission of the instructor.\n\nIn 11W, The French Gothic. This course will study the Gothic as associated with tales of terror, dark settings and strange creatures, but also as a critical term that questions literary verisimilitude, excessive imagination, and exposes literary fabrication based on replaying of old elements in new contexts. The course will read from the works of Mérimée, Nodier, Verne and Villiers de l’Isle-Adam and discuss theoretical works on fantastic, horror and simulacrum by Baudrillard, Kristeva, and Todorov, among others.\n\nIn 11F, A Festival of the Intellect/A Collapse of the Intellect: French and Francophone Poetry from Baudelaire through Césaire. Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul Eluard, André Breton, Paul Valéry, Aimé Césaire, Léon Damas, D.T.

Considerable research over the past several decades has shown that anthropogenic disturbance has significantly modified natural processes frequently leading to degraded conditions. The goal of the course is first to establish that shifts in climate, vegetation, and landscapes are “natural” and have occurred over geologic time and that the timing and magnitude of these shifts provides the necessary background to evaluate the type, magnitude, and frequency of anthropogenic disturbance. The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change. In the last part of the class, we will focus on how global environmental changes generate impacts at the local scale, and how small-scale transformations propagate into large-scale global environmental issues.",

In an international community committed to free trade, why is food the most common source of trade wars and controversies? In a country where less than five percent of the population farms, why does the “farm lobby” remain so politically powerful? In societies where food has never been faster or more processed, why are organic and “slow” foods in such demand? These are among the questions this course will consider, drawing on the insights of both political economy and cultural analysis.",

While its streets may not have been ‘paved with gold,’ they led to factories and jobs and the opportunity to rise up the socioeconomic ladder. The city was America’s vehicle for advancement and assimilation—the classic melting pot. Today, most Americans live and work in the suburbs that stretch for miles away from the central city. For that portion of the population denied this opportunity (the poor, minorities), the American Dream remains unrealized.

As one of the most powerful institutions in American society, law exerts a pervasive influence on our conceptions and practices of identity. Yet how has a legal system purportedly based on the recognition and protection of individual rights been implicated in the creation of racial categories and inequality? The class explores this question by examining debates over two important legal controversies: segregation and affirmative action. In both instances, legal disputes over the allocation of resources, rights, and privileges have been articulated both in terms of race and geography. Legal precedents and the legacies of racial segregation are both extremely resistant to change, and can affect social and geographic interactions in unexpected ways for long periods of time. In addition to addressing these substantive issues, the class provides an introduction to legal research, the Federal court system, and Constitutional law. Dist. SOC; WCult: CI.",

     "This course focuses on the uses of GIS techniques in solving practical environmental problems. The ideas of how GIS can be applied to various fields of environmental studies and applications will be presented, and this is achieved through examining real application examples concerning soils, watershed hydrology, vegetation, landuse/land cover, climate, pollutions, landscape ecology, and natural hazards. The students will also learn fundamental knowledge and techniques required in application projects for solving environmental problems, including the methodology of starting and running such projects, and spatial analytical techniques that are frequently used in such projects. The course is made of three components: the lectures, the lab exercises, and the term project. The software packages used for the lab exercises include ArcGIS and IDRISI.

This seminar will introduce students to four major issues in German culture during the twentieth century: Grossstadt, Gewalt und Antisemitismus; Stunde Null; Multikulturalismus; and Die Berliner Republik. Through primary readings in German and study of visual and musical material, students will become familiar with the methods of cultural studies, with the use of different media to explore a topic, and will improve their spoken and written German. The course includes oral presentations of paper topics. Conducted in German.\n\nGerman majors take this course for Senior Seminar credit by doing additional work.\n\nOpen to all classes.\n\nIn 12W, Masterpieces of German Drama. This course treats eight of the greatest plays ever written in German, paired to highlight historical links, thematic continuities, and formal innovations persisting throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. Lessing’s Nathan der Weise and Frisch’s Andorra address issues of religious and racial tolerance; Goethe’s Iphigenie and Kleist’s Penthesilea analyze attitudes toward women; Schiller’s Wallenstein and Brecht’s Mutter Courage examine the causes of history; Büchner’s Dantons Tod and Weiss’s Marat/Sade debate the reasons for revolution. Aided by audio and visual means, students also read theoretical texts concerning theater as practiced in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

The course will first consider the general theoretical concepts underlying empirical research, including the nature of causality, the structure and content of theories, and the formulation and testing of competing hypotheses. The course will then employ these concepts to develop several quantitative approaches to political analysis. Students will be introduced to two statistical methods frequently used by political scientists, contingency tables and linear regression. By learning to systematically analyze political data, students will gain the ability to better conduct and evaluate empirical research in both its quantitative and qualitative forms. Because of the large overlap in material covered, no student may receive credit for more than one of the courses Government 10, Economics 10, Mathematics 10, Psychology 10, Social Sciences 10, Mathematics and Social Sciences 15 or 45, or Sociology 10 except by special petition.",

Subjects may therefore vary each time the course is offered.\n\nIn 11W at 11, Advanced Political Analysis. This course introduces mathematical and statistical models in the social sciences beyond the level of bivariate regression.  Topics to be covered include multivariate regression, selection bias, discrete choice, maximum likelihood models, multi-level modeling, and experiments.  We will use these models to study voter turnout, elections, bargaining in legislatures, public opinion, political tolerance, the causes and duration of wars, gender bias in employment, educational testing, poverty and income, and a host of other topics.  Students will write a paper of original research using some of the methods covered in class.  Prerequisite:  Government 10, Economics 10, Geography 10, Mathematics 10, Psychology 10, Social Sciences 10, or equivalent.\n\nIn 12S at 2, Research Design and Qualitative Analysis. This course surveys qualitative methods and research design. First, it introduces qualitative methods’ tools, techniques, strengths and limitations. It then explores the craft of research design and effective communication. Unlike traditional political analysis courses, this class is a practicum for those actively engaged in research. It is ideal for individuals contemplating a thesis or independent study because students concentrate on one topic throughout the term.

Countries in developing regions of the world face a number of unique challenges within a globalized economy as their financial and trade links become ever closely intertwined with those of powerful, developed countries that dominate international economic institutions. Drawing on a wide range of case studies, this course investigates some of these new developments in the world economy. What strategies can developing countries adapt in order to develop most efficiently in a global market-oriented economy? How can a country maximize its chances for economic success, and what precisely is the role of international financial and trade institutions in their development? Readings in this course range from theoretical academic writings on development strategies to policy pieces written by local practitioners and by those working for international financial and trade institutions.

Subjects may therefore vary each time the course is offered.\n\nIn 10F and 12W at 11, American Elections and Voting Behavior. This course will introduce students to the study of elections and voting behavior.  Topics to be covered include partisanship in the electorate, voter turnout, nomination rules and procedures, campaign organization and strategy, and the effects of campaigns on voters.  Although we will focus on the United States, throughout the course comparisons will be made with other industrialized democracies in order to better understand the peculiar features of elections in the U.S.  The course will also provide a non-technical introduction to some of the methods used by political scientists to study public opinion, elections and voting behavior.  Because of the timing of the course, special attention will be paid to the results of the 2004 presidential and congressional elections and the outlook for the 2006 midterm elections.\n\nIn 12W at 10A, The Federal Budget. This course will investigate the U.S. federal budget. Students will come to understand the history of, contemporary practices in and future trajectory of U.S. expenditure and revenue generating policies. The course will also cover the process by which policymakers pass an annual budget including what is supposed to happen and what actually happens in pursuit of a budget compromise. Substantial course time will be spent considering possible reforms that can be made to the federal budget.\n\nIn 11W at 11, Law and Politics of the Environment. Although most Americans believe that environmental protection should be a policy priority, environmental regulation is routinely criticized for delivering only modest benefits at an exorbitant cost.  This course provides an overview of the development and current state of environmental law and policy in the United States, with special attention to the recurring technical and political challenges that frustrate policymakers’ attempts to solve environmental problems. Huber.\n\nIn 11W at 2A. The Presidency and the Public in American Politics. This is a course on the interaction between the president and the public. We will explore different theories about when and why the president might seek to alter policy in response to public attitudes as compared to when the president will seek to change public opinion. We will analyze the various techniques and strategies presidents use to understand public opinion in the current era, and the strategies they use to affect public views. We will examine whether the president is more or less responsive to public opinion in different issue areas, including: war and conflict, international trade, domestic social policy, and macroeconomic policy. Throughout the course, we will compare the approach that President Barack Obama has taken towards the public with that of previous presidents. D.\n\nIn 11F and 11S at 2A, Women in Politics. This is a general course on women in politics. We will examine the role of women as politicians, activists, and voters. The course will examine a wide range of issue areas, including: female attitudes on war and conflict, the reactions of women to different kinds of campaign tactics and policy positions, the differing barriers women face to attaining elected office in different countries, and how the challenges thought to be faced by female political leaders compare with those faced by female business leaders. One key question we will explore concerns whether female politicians are treated differently than male politicians, and how that might affect their strategies for reelection and governance. D.\n\nIn 11S at 12, The American Legal System. A legal system is an integral part of a nation’s political system. It provides mechanisms for implementing and reformulating public policies, for resolving individual and group conflicts, and for holding political and economic processes to certain standards of fairness. This course will examine selected features of the American legal system and the ways it deals with basic social problems, e.g., regulating criminal law enforcement, controlling physical and environmental hazards that stem from industrial technology, and regulating the struggle for economic power. Readings and lectures will explore how the American legal system’s approach to these problems has changed over time.\n\nIn 11X at 10A and 12S at 2A, Survey Research in Business and Politics. Pollsters in politics and marketing researchers in business all devote a great deal of energy to discovering the attitudes of the public, regarding public policies and politicians for the former and products and services for the latter. In this course, we will explore the general techniques that political pollsters and marketing researchers use to discover how the public thinks, and we will compare how this information is used in different contexts. We will discuss questions such as: can similar techniques be used to introduce unfamiliar politicians and products to the public? Does “brand strategy” apply to politicians and products in similar ways? How is advertising used to improve the market share of candidates and products? Can negative advertising be applied with equal effect to harm competitors in the business and political realms? How will politicians and businesses seek to understand and influence the preferences of the public as technological changes produce new opportunities and challenges regarding interactions with the public?

Subjects may therefore vary each time the course is offered.\n\nIn 10F at 2A, Politics of Iraq. This course examines the modern politics of Iraq and the historical forces which have shaped contemporary Iraqi politics.  It covers Iraq’s formation in the aftermath of World War One, the British mandatory experience, Arab nationalism, Ba’thism and Saddam’s rule, as well as the 2003 invasion and its aftermath.  It examines the roles of sectarianism, ethnicity and tribalism, the impact of oil, and Iraq’s regional context.\n\nIn 11W at 2, Politics of Africa. This course examines post-colonial politics in sub-Saharan Africa, with particular focus on the events of the last decade. The course will be structured around three main themes: (1) patterns of economic growth and decline; (2) the transition to democratic political systems; and (3) political violence and civil conflict. While the course covers broad trends across the continent, it will also draw on case studies from particular countries.\n\nIn 11S at 12, Political Economy of the Arab Gulf States. For decades the Arab Gulf states—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait—were viewed both economically and politically as anomalies, utterly dependent on world oil markets for their development, conservative if not backward, and marked by highly authoritarian regimes.  However, the creation within the region of the Gulf Cooperation Council as an economic bloc, and the emergence of Dubai as a post-oil financial and commercial center for the region, are clear indicators of the changing economic (and perhaps political) fortunes of the local countries.\n\nIn 12W at 12, Globalization and Global Development, The latest wave of economic globalization has differently affected various regions of the world. One of the most often repeated (and disputed) assertions is that the economic power of the United States is fading and that the fortunes of the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) as well as other selected Emerging Economies (“the Second World”) will mark the dawn of a more equal and, economically speaking, a more balanced global economy. The most recent financial crisis has put into question many of the assertions on both sides of this debate, in ways that question the very basic assumptions analysts of the global economy have been making since the creation of the Bretton Woods system in the aftermath of World War II. In this course we investigate the impact of the economic boom of the last two decades, the current crisis, and their impact on the economic fate and standing of particularly the United States, India, China, and Russia. We focus in part on efforts to create a new financial architecture for the global economy, and investigate how the debate between markets and state intervention has been affected by the ongoing financial crisis—and what this may mean for both countries that rely extensively on markets, and for those that strategically promote state intervention.",

     "For the better part of a century, the conflict over Palestine has defied resolution. The tensions and instability it has generated have profoundly affected—and been affected by—both international relations and the domestic politics of a wide range of countries. This course examines the changing external and local forces that have shaped the confrontation. Using primary as well as secondary sources, we will try to understand how the various parties to the conflict have defined its stakes, understood their interests, viewed their adversaries, mobilized support, and formulated policy. We will consider grassroots politics as well as elite calculations. We will look at the role played by ideas, institutions, material interests, and leadership, at both the regional and the broader international levels. We will end by assessing the current prospects for a settlement.\n\nPrerequisite: Government 4, or permission of the instructor.",

     "This course will enable regular or visiting faculty members to examine topics in International Relations not treated in the established curriculum. Subjects may therefore vary each time the course is offered.\n\nIn 10F at 10 and 2, and in 11W and 11S at 2, 12W and 12S at 10 What’s So Civil about War Anyway? Civil wars are far more common in the contemporary world than international wars. They tend to affect more people, go on for longer, and destroy more property. Yet most of our theory and expertise on war derives from experiences of international war. Are the two types of conflict essentially similar? What’s so civil about civil war? Are civil wars simply international wars played out within borders? Or might the causes, dynamics, and consequences of civil war differ fundamentally from those of inter-state war? Finally, what role do international politics play in civil war (and vice versa)? In this course, we will compare and contrast civil and international war placing special emphasis on modern cases of civil war, its international dimensions and potential strategies for conflict resolution. Topics addressed will include intervention, ethnic conflict, guerilla war and non-state actors.\n\nIn 10F at 2A European Union as a Foreign Policy Actor. This course deals with the ‘adventure’ of 27 sovereign European states seeking to develop a common foreign and security policy. Why are they doing it and how are they going about it? What decision-making procedures have they developed and what foreign policy concepts? What are the results in terms of policies? Where do the strengths and weaknesses lie? Is the European Union a potential superpower? How is the United States affected? Mahncke.\n\nIn 11W at 2 Human Rights and International Relation. This course examines the role that the international human rights regime plays in international politics. The goal of the course is to critically assess the extent to which international human rights institutions have been successful in bringing about improvements in states’ human rights practices in recent years. In doing so we shall engage with a number of interesting theoretical and practical debates such as how the concept of human rights should be defined, the claim that human rights are a Western invention, the impact of the human rights regime on state sovereignty, and the importance of non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International in the politics of human rights.\n\nIn 11W and 12W at 2A, International Relations of East Asia. The international relations of Asia are a major concern of the United States. In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about the threat North Korea may pose to the security of the United States. The past decade has seen China emerge as a potential economic, political, and military superpower, that some view as a potential rival to the U.S. Japan’s economy, although experiencing difficulties, remains the world’s second largest and most technologically advanced. What happens in Asia has a direct and important impact on the U.S.? How do we understand the international relations of these countries? What are the issues, and consequences? In answering these questions, we will view the international relations of Asia from historical and theoretical viewpoints. I assume that students are familiar with the basic tools of inter-national relations theory, including realism, liberalism, and institutionalism. In addition I assume prior coursework in international relations. I do not assume extensive knowledge of Asia. Government 5 is recommended but not required.\n\nIn 12S at 2A, Nuclear Weapons: Physical and Strategic Effects. This course examines the effects of nuclear weapons on the conduct of international politics. It begins by examining the physical properties of nuclear weapons, and then uses evidence from the Cold War to address the following questions: Why did the United States and Soviet Union build such large nuclear arsenals? What did they plan to do with these weapons? How did nuclear weapons fit into U.S. and Soviet military strategy at various phases of the Cold War? The course uses evidence from the Cold War to evaluate theories of nuclear deterrence and the so-called “nuclear peace.” The last section of the course focuses on current issues relating to nuclear weapons: the spread of nuclear weapons in the developing world, the dangers of nuclear terrorism, the potential for effective missile defenses, and the changing strategic nuclear balance of power.\n\nIn 11S and 12S at 10A, War and Peace in the Modern Age (Identical to Social Sciences 1 and War and Peace Studies 1). This course is designed to acquaint students with the fundamentals of war and peace; that is, with the political uses of military power and the respective roles of military and civilian leaders in formulating and implementing foreign policy. We will also investigate how war affects civil society’s social movements and how the characteristics of states’ domestic politics arrangements affect or constrain the ways that leaders choose to execute their most preferred strategies. Finally, we will also try to come to an understanding of what war is actually like for those, both combatant and non-combatant, that must participate in war on a daily basis.",

These immediate objectives serve a larger purpose: to make you a better strategist and more sophisticated analyst of foreign policy. The empirical focus of the course is on states and their problems, but its basic precepts are applicable to other domains as well. Each of the decision-making theories we study represents a venerable tradition of social science scholarship. Mastering them can contribute to the acquisition of extremely useful analytical and critical skills. The first four sections of the course introduce the four most basic models of strategic decision-making and explore them in selected case studies.

     "This course will enable regular or visiting faculty members to examine topics in Political Theory or Public Law not treated in the established curriculum. Subjects may therefore vary each time the course is offered.\n\nIn 10F and 11X at 10A. American Political Thought. The course focuses on the period from the Revolution to the Civil War. Topics include toleration, constitutionalism, rights, individualism, and slavery. Readings are drawn mainly from primary sources, including Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Hamilton, Jackson, Calhoun, Taylor, Anthony, Thoreau, and Lincoln.\n\nIn 10F and 11F at 10, Ethics and Public Policy (Identical to Public Policy 42). This course examines the nature and validity of arguments about vexing moral issues in public policy.  Students examine a number of basic moral controversies in public life, focusing on different frameworks for thinking about justice and he ends of politics.  The primary aim of the course is to provide each student with an opportunity to develop his/her ability to think in sophisticated ways about morally difficult policy issues.  Amount the questions students address will be the following:  Are policies that permit torture justifiable under any circumstances?  Do people have basic moral claims to unequal economic holdings and rewards, or should economic distribution be patterned for the sake of social justice?  Should people be permitted to move freely between countries?   Is abortion wrong, in theory or in practice, and in what ways should it be restricted?\n\nIn 11W at 10A and 11X at 2A, Immigration, Asylum and Politics. This course examines the topic of immigration and asylum from a political, social, legal and public policy perspective. As a nation of immigrants, much of our self-identity is bound up in the idea that we are forever the “unfinished” nation. What does this mean? How are our views and policies on immigration different from those of other nations with different identities and histories? How do we address the problems of security and the need (both in law and philosophy) to provide a safe haven to those who seek asylum from persecution elsewhere?\n\nIn 11S at 2A, Democratic Theory. Can we defend the value of democracy against serious and thoughtful criticism? Using a combination of classic and contemporary texts, this course encourages students to think rigorously about one of their most basic political values. It examines the origins of democratic theory in ancient Athenian political practice and the normative and practical criticisms of more contemporary thinkers. What makes politics “democratic?” What features distinguish the democratic regime from other regimes? What is democracy supposed to reflect or achieve? And what kinds of concerns about democracy did ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle raise? How (and why) did early modern and Enlightenment thinkers relocate the grounds for preferring democracy to other regimes? Dist; TMV, WCult: W.\n\nIn 11S at 2A and 12S at 10A, Ethics, Everyday Life and Law. What is the right thing to do? What is the best way of life? How, if at all, should the answers to these questions bear on politics and law? Some hold that morality is intensely demanding, and asks us to overcome the natural concern for ourselves and those close to us. Others argue that the moral life is simple and relatively easy to comply with. Are morally excellent people happier—or is happiness beside the point of morality. Does a political community that enshrines the “pursuit of happiness” as among its foundational goals need to take a concern with the moral character of citizens? These questions will be investigated through readings that move between the history of moral and political thought (Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Mill) and cases and questions drawn from contemporary life.\n\nIn 11F at 12, Indigenous Nationalism: Native Rights and Sovereignty (Identical to Native American Studies 36). This course focuses on the legal and political relationship between the indigenous peoples of Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand and their respective colonial governments. Students will examine contemporary indigenous demands for self-government, especially territorial claims, within the context of the legislative and political practices of their colonial governments. The course will begin with an examination of the notion of Aboriginal self-government in Canada and develop it in light of the policy recommendations found in the recent report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996). Using the Canadian experience as a benchmark, students will then compare these developments to indigenous peoples’ experiences in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. An important theme of the course will be to develop an international approach to the issue of indigenous rights and to explore how colonial governments are responding to indigenous demands for justice. Not open to first-year students without permission of instructor.\n\nIn 11F at 2, Liberalism and Its Critics. Liberal political theory is renowned for its emphasis on rights, freedoms, and limited government; but critics of liberalism hold that the liberal legacy in free societies is one of misguided energies and broken promises. Students in this course chart the development of liberal thought from the Seventeenth Century to the present, with a view to considering the central values and commitments liberals may share, and examining important contemporary work in liberal theory. The course integrates weighty challenges to the moral and political viability of liberalism, from communitarian, conservative, libertarian, and postmodern critics. Government 6 recommended.\n\nIn 11F at 2A, Theorizing Free Speech. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution reads in part: “Congress shall make no law. . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...or the right of the people to peacefully assemble.” This course examines the philosophical and constitutional issues regarding the First Amendment’s speech, press, and association clauses. Readings draw from Supreme Court cases and secondary sources. Areas covered include: philosophical foundations of free speech, compelled speech, defamation, hate speech, expressive discrimination, obscenity and pornography.

     "This course examines how gender and law in the United States are used to confer rights, create obligations, and define identities. We explore the theoretical, historical, and empirical basis for gender in law, and pay particular attention to how and when gender-based laws have changed over time. Specific topics covered include, for example, federal legislation on educational and workplace equity, constitutional doctrines of equality and privacy, and state policies on family law, criminal responsibility, and domestic violence. We analyze the relationship between gender politics, legal theory, legal doctrine, and social policy. We also ask whether the gender of legal actors (litigants, lawyers, judges) makes a difference in their reasoning or decision-making.\n\nPrerequisite: Government 3 or a law course strongly recommended.",

     "In 11W at 10 (Section 1), The Politics of New World Emancipation, 1770-1880. The course charts the political struggles over the nature and status of “New World” bound labor from the late eighteenth century British critiques of the African slave trade through the end of plantation slavery in Brazil roughly a hundred years later. Readings will explore both those transnational connections and the multiple actors that helped make these years an “age of emancipation.” Major\n\nIn 11W at 10 (Section 2), Gender and Sexuality: Asians in America. In this course we examine the ascendance of sexuality and gender as primary categories for organizing Asian American identities in the media, economy, law, and in politics. Between 1875 and 1943, Asian women were special targets for immigration exclusion and sexual policing. This shaped the possibilities for both men’s and women’s citizenship, employment, and reproduction. Other events shaping Asian American gendered and sexual economies that we will review include wars, imperialism, globalization, and military expansion. Major\n\nIn 11W at 2 (Section 3), Civil Rights in the United States in the 20th Century (Identical to African and African American Studies 80). This course examines movements for civil rights, broadly defined, in the 20th century U.S. Students explore concepts of American citizenship, considering struggles for political inclusion and efforts to participate fully in the nation’s social and cultural life. We focus on women’s and gay rights and the struggles of African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and Asians, examining how these and other groups have envisioned and pursued full American citizenship. Major\n\nIn 11S at 10A (Section 1), Epidemics in History: Etiologies and Ideologies. Disease is a biological phenomenon as well as a social, behavioral, political, institutional, and scientific one. Although infections usually require the presence of microscopic pathogens or parasites, the scope of disease outbreaks on a larger scale is always eminently social. As such, historians have a lot to offer microbiologists, doctors, and public health officials in explaining epidemics. In this course, we will examine the politics of addressing disease outbreaks, the institutional and social conditions of possibility for patterns of disease transmission, and finally, the cultural significations diseases have assumed over time. Major\n\nIn 11S at 10 (Section 2), Crusades and Culture 1095-1350. The crusades, launched by European Christians who sought to secure military control over the Holy Land, led to a period of sustained and largely inimical contact between Christian and Muslim cultures. Covering the period from 1095-ca.1350, this course explores the cultural, religious, and ideological contexts of crusade history which shaped notions of religious violence, holy war, and ethnic cleansing, along with a long history of distrust between the peoples of Christian Europe (or the Christian West) and the Islamic Middle East.\n\nIn 11S at 10A, Nationalism and Revolution in the Caribbean (Identical to, and described under African and African American Studies 86 and Latin American and Caribbean Studies 54).\n\nIn 11X at 10A, American Transcendentalism in Historical Perspective.\n\nIn 11F at 10A, Epidemics in History: Etiologies and Ideologies.\n\nIn 12W at 2, Topics in Native American History.\n\nIn 12W at 10, Gender and Sexuality: Asians in America.\n\nIn 12W at 2A, The Life, Death and Rebirth of Great American Cities.\n\nIn 12W at 12, Topics in Medieval History.\n\nIn 12S at 2A, War and Society in Early America.\n\nIn 12S at 10, History of Vietnam to 1945.\n\nIn 12S at 12, Crusades and Culture 1095-1350.\n\nIn 12S at 2, From Coca to Cocaine: Drug Economies in Latin America.",

Now, new methods in the study of American history have completely changed the way we understand the period. This course will focus on the seminal task of nation building, when distinctively American political parties, cities and villages, gender roles, educational systems, decorative arts, cultural institutions, attitudes toward Native peoples, architecture and economic policies took form.

     "A course on the intellectual and cultural origins of European civilization, from the fall of Rome to the advent of the Renaissance. After a review of the Judeo-Christian, Greco-Roman, Celtic, and Germanic components of medieval culture, we will examine the rise of the Christian Church and its impact on values and behavior of Europeans during the middle ages. Of special interest will be the relationship between medieval thinkers and the society in which they lived, the role of ritual, ceremony, and magic, and the persistence of heresy. Along with the products of high culture associated with such intellectuals as Augustine, Peter Abelard, Hildegard of Bingen, and Thomas Aquinas, we will thus review the fundamental values of medieval society at large and explore ways in which popular and elite culture converged or contrasted.\n\nOpen to all classes.",

     "Half a century later, the Holocaust is viewed as the central, traumatic event of modern Western experience and history. But the struggle between the desire to forget and efface it, and the impulse to remember, uncover, and record the minute details of its reality, has engendered a challenge to the limits of representation—to the very possibility of recalling, describing, and depicting what many judge to be the unrepresentable. This course explores the history and memory of the Holocaust as presented in the historical documents, survivor/perpetrator testimonies, memoirs, fictions, and in cinematic and visual images.",

After a brief survey of the physical and cultural geography of the region, the course examines the history of selected countries to highlight the way European conquest and colonialism have molded Latin American institutions and attitudes. The course then turns to particular case studies of contemporary life and society to analyze the ongoing problems of ethnicity, inequality, and political repression engendered by the region’s colonial past. Finally, the course draws on these historical and anthropological understandings to assess recent economic, social, and political developments in Latin America. By juxtaposing historical realities with their living consequences, the course presents a multi-disciplinary perspective on the nature, dynamics—and future prospects—of the many peoples who inhabit this vast and diverse continent.",

This course will examine how authors of detective fiction in Latin America have adapted the genre to treat issues of political, economic and historical significance. Although critics have denounced the classic whodunnit as an imported model, and therefore poorly suited to the realities of the region, noted authors or Latin America’s Boom have experimented with the detective formula in one form or another. Moreover, during the last three decades, detective fiction has witnessed its own “boom” and authors in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba and Mexico have adapted the grittier, hardboiled model to denounce dictatorship, violence and social injustice in their respective countries. After briefly surveying the origins of the detective story and its ideological underpinnings, the class will study short stories and novels in each of three regions (Argentina, Cuba and Mexico), contextualizing these works within their historica context. Throughout the term, we will consider the relationship between ideology and popular literature, art and censorship, the dilemma of imitation and authen ticity, and the problematic of gender representation and national politics in this male-dominated genre.

We will examine how Afro-Brazilian writers have expanded Brazilian literary discourse by challenging dominant cultural narratives of race and ethnicity. The course will also seek to place Afro-Brazilian literature within the context of African diasporic literatures of the Americas, particularly Afro-American literature of the United States. The course will introduce students to the extraordinary diversity of Afro-Brazilian narrative, with texts ranging from nineteenth-century poems written by a former slave to the 1997 novel that inspired the hit film City of God. The course will be taught in English and all texts will be available in translation.",

Yet the break-neck speed and seemingly “effortless” way that young children acquire language remain its most miraculous characteristic. We will discover the biological capacities and the important social, family, and educational factors that, taken together, make this feat pos-sible and establish the basic facts of language acquisition, involving children’s babbling, phonology, early vocabulary, morphology, syntax, semantics, and discourse knowledge, as well as their early gestural and pragmatic competence. Prevailing theoretical explanations and research methods will be explored. We will dispel myths of how bilingual children acquire two languages from birth. We will leave our hearing-speaking modality and explore the world of language acquisition in total silence regarding the acquisition of natural signed languages—as innovative lens into the factors that are most key in acquiring all language. Critically, we will evaluate the efficacy of how language is presently taught to young children in schools in light of the facts of human language acquisition. Open to all classes.",

This course introduces theories of discourse, communication and sociolinguistics and illustrates how Asian and Middle Eastern cultures employ language to construct and reflect values, identities and institutions, to negotiate relationships, and to perform actions (such as ending a phone call, apologizing, worshipping and writing a scientific paper). Particular attention will be paid to uses of orality and literacy, to gender and ethnicity, and to the social and material contexts in which language and literature operate.

The Caucasus mountains, bridging the Black and Caspian Seas, are home to over 50 indigenous languages belonging to three separate, unrelated families. Guest lectures by Visting Professor Ramaz Kurdadze of Tbilisi State University, Georgia. Caucasian languages have unusually large consonant inventories (“clusters and closures”), and relatively small vowel inventories (“releases”). This course examines the phonetic inventories and their historical evolution within the region and typologically through analysis of phonetic data, phonological processes, and sound change.

     "In 11S, Beethoven in Context. This course examines the life and music of Ludwig van Beethoven. In the hands of critics, historians, and visual artists of his own time, Beethoven was elevated to the status of a genius, a perception that persists today. Nineteenth-century representations of Beethoven as a towering persona will be compared with modern biographies, recordings, and video productions in order to construct an accurate picture of Beethoven, the creative artist and the man. Students will listen to and discuss works that illustrate the developments in Beethoven’s compositional style. Performers will present in-class recitals of Beethoven’s music, and attendance at selected Hopkins Center concerts featuring Beethoven’s music will be required.\n\nNo prerequisite.",

     "In the past, American Indian history and experience have usually been taught through the lens of the dominant culture, while ignoring the accounts that Indian people have presented in their own words. This course will examine some key issues in Native American history and culture reflected in the biographies and autobiographies of individual American Indians. Their life stories, some contemporary and some historical, will help us understand the forces affecting the world of Native people, and how they shaped their own lives in response. Many early (auto)biographies are “as-told-to” narratives. Consequently, as a point of methodology, we will take time to consider the role, motives, and the effect of the amanuensis (the recorder of an oral narrative) on the story, and as a mediator of Native experience.\n\nOpen to all classes.",

Students will examine contemporary indigenous demands for self-government, especially territorial claims, within the context of the legislative and political practices of their colonial governments. The course will begin with an examination of the notion of Aboriginal self-government in Canada and develop it in light of the policy recommendations found in the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996). Using the Canadian experience as a benchmark, students will then compare these developments to indigenous peoples’ experiences in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

The complex matrix of legal and political relations between Indian tribes and the federal government thus serves as a singularly important arena to examine contested notions of national identity, sovereignty, relationships to lands and people, and concepts of justice.

Wherever Ursidae Carnivora finds a natural habitat, the indigenous peoples of these geographies honor and acknowledge the Bear in particular ways, central to individual and cultural expression. This course engages various texts that feature Bear imagery in traditional stories, songs, and ritual representations—all vehicles that transmit both sacred and practical knowledge. We use readings in mythopoetics, performance narratives, nature writing, some early ethnographic accounts and recordings, environmental literature, and the contemporary writing of several Native American authors. Discussions about the tribal significance of the Bear are a means to examine ontological distinctions between human self and animal, and contemporary notions of human consciousness within the natural world. We also discuss how concepts of “wildness” and “wilderness,” and ideas about “control” and “freedom” are expressed within imaginative and geographical spaces.",

Psychology must struggle with the more tangible question of how to study emotions and thereby interpret their influence on behavior. In this course, we will examine how psychologists (past and present) have attempted to study emotion. We will augment this information by learning how the brain supports emotional processing. We will then consider human disorders where emotional processing has gone wrong, as this will inform us about how things were supposed to work in the first place. And, then, we will be in a better position to answer the really big questions. What is an emotion? Who has emotions? Do you? Does your neighbor? Do German Shepherds?

     "Courses with this number consider topics from the areas of perception, memory, cognition, and quantitative models from the point of view of information processing. Material is treated at an intermediate level on a set of issues not covered in Psychology 21 and 28. Selection of issues is left to the discretion of the instructor, but specific emphasis is given to methodology. Enrollment limited to 35 students.\n\nIn 10F at 2, History of Psychology. Harvard Philosopher George Santayana said “those that cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” (Life of Reason, 1905). Is that happening right now in Psychology? The goal of this course is to enrich our understanding of current psychological theory by understanding its intellectual origins. We will trace the origins of the current influential schools of thought in psychology to determine what is really new, and what was anticipated by earlier generations. We will see that early psychologists, without the aid of modern technologies, came up with some incredibly clever ways to solve experimental problems, many supplying answers that have held up to this day. Prerequisite: Psychology 1 or 6.  Hughes and Whalen.\n\nIn 11W at 11, The Roles of the Human Fronto-Parietal Network: Executive Control, Planning, Attention, Volition and Mental Causation of Action.\n\nThis course will focus on neural circuitry underlying decision-making, planning, and attention. Inherent to planning and executive control are issues of selection and inhibition from among possible courses of action, evaluation of stimuli, and an assessment of how best to accomplish goals. Our goal will be to shed light on ancient philosophical questions of free will, mental causation, and the mind-body problem by looking at what neuroscience can teach us. Prerequisite: Psychology 1 or 6.\n\nIn 11W at 2, Mind and Brain. It is believed that the mind is a manifestation of the brain. Think of computers. The brain is hardware, the mind is software. Is it possible to understand algorithms of the software by investigating physical activity of the hardware? This course will take the mind and brain problem as a theme to guide discussions about neural underpinnings of various mental phenomena. Cutting-edge research across Psychology, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy of Mind will be covered.\n\nIn 11S at 2, Attention. In our everyday environment, a massive amount of information pours into our sensory organs, but only a small subset of it reaches awareness. What determines how much information is passed on to higher levels of processing? In this course, we will explore this classic question of capacity limits on human information processing with particular emphasis on the role of attention. Through lectures and discussions, we will examine the cognitive and neural mechanisms of attention. Prerequisite: Psychology 1 or 6.",

Material is treated at an intermediate level on a set of issues not covered in Psychology 22 and 25. Selection of issues is left to the discretion of the instructor, but they will be selected with emphasis upon the psychological principles emerging from the study of humans and animals in the context of learning, early experience, and maturations. Enrollment limited to 35 students.\n\nIn 11W at 12, Evolutionary Psychology. In this course we examine the human mind and behavior from a broad evolutionary perspective. We start by covering the main principles of evolution and Darwin’s most extraordinary insight: the evolution of all species from a single, common ancestor. Then we make the important causal connection to our minds by building up from genes to mind. We next consider how sex and reproductive strategies influence male and female behavior in a variety of species, including humans. We then examine the evolutionary influences on family life, and look to child development for evidence of innate knowledge. Limitations in our cognitive processing, and universals in social and emotional processing provide further evidence for evolved adaptations. Throughout the course, we will consider how the most enigmatic and compelling of human qualities, such as love, aggression, morality and culture, are influenced by our evolutionary history. Prerequisite: Psych 1 or Psych 6.\n\nIn 11S: 9L, Developmental Psychopathology. This course will provide an Introduction to childhood Psychopathology using a developmental perspective. Written materials and lectures will focus on the diagnosis, etiology and treatment of a variety of childhood problems, including autism, anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, depression, attachment disorders, conduct disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Prerequisite: Psychology 1 or 6 and 24, 25, or 59.\n\nIn 11S at 11, Animal Learning and Behavior. This course will survey the study of animal behavior, beginning with a consideration of evolutionary theory. Topics will include reproductive behavior, self-maintenance and defensive behaviors, and social interactions in a wide range of species. Animal learning theory will be integrated into these analyses.

In a fleeting glance, we can identify a person, infer their emotional state, determine their gender, estimate their age, assess their attractiveness, andsurmise the focus of their thoughts. Social perception is fundamental to social interaction in humans as well as other animals. This course will examine social perception in humans and other species and in doing so will touch on issues including functional specialization and neurocognitive development and evolution. Faces have received much of the attention in social perception and we’ll spend significant time on face perception, but we’ll also cover body perception, biological motion perception, voice perception, and some of the various types of social perception in non-human animals. We will draw on a range of approaches including psychophysics, neuropsychology, single-cell recording, transcranial magnetic stimulation, fMRI, and twin studies.",

     "A unitary sense of self that exists across time and place is a central feature of human experience. Understanding the nature of self-what it is and what it does-has challenged scholars for many centuries. Although most people intuitively understand what is meant by the term self, definitions have tended toward the philosophical and metaphysical. Efforts at creating more formal definitions have largely been unsuccessful, as many features of self are empirically murky, difficult to identify and assess using objective methods. Yet the phenomenological experience of self is highly familiar to everyone. So, at issue is not whether the self exists, but how best to study it. This course will survey contemporary approaches to understanding the self, with a strong emphasis on approaches from social psychology. We will consider self’s development, its cognitive and affective components, motives related to it, and how it is regulated. We will consider its functional basis, examining both its adaptive and maladaptive consequences. We will also examine its neurological basis, including case studies of people with disorders of self.

After examining different conceptions of the human body in traditional China, we will focus on sexual practices advocated by the traditions of immortality seekers, Daoism, and esoteric Buddhism as ways to enlightenment and transcendence. In our explorations we will look at the earliest records of sexual practices found in tombs of the 3rd century B.C.E. and examine Daoist sexual initiation rites and secret rites practiced by emperors. We will consider how notions of cosmic powers and forces are expressed in sexual rituals and how society views such practices.

Yet the course is called “Women and the Bible,” not “Women in the Bible,” and implicit in this title is a second goal of the course: not only to look at the Bible to see what it actually says about women but also to look at differing ways that modern feminist biblical scholars have engaged in the enterprise of interpreting the biblical text. \n\nOpen to all classes.\n\nFor courses at the Introductory level in Biblical and Ancient Near Eastern Religions, see courses numbered 4-5.",

     "An examination of Russia as a cultural, national, and historical entity part of and yet apart from both Europe and Asia. Russia is a continental power of vast proportions whose traditions, character, national myths, and forms of political organization often seem a mirror-image to those of the United States. After a brief survey of Russian history, the course will examine certain determinants of Russian culture, including Christianity, multinationalism, and the status of Russian civilization on the periphery of Europe. The course will then deal with the art, music, and popular literature of Russia, and conclude by examining certain contemporary issues, including the complex coexistence of Russian and Soviet culture.

     "This course explores the emergence of ethnic identity and nationalism among the peoples of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and their successor states. Drawing on anthropological and historical works, it examines the process of formation of a centralized multiethnic Russian empire and the liberation struggle of its nationalities prior to 1917. It then proceeds to the crucial period of 1917-1991 and explores the theory and practice of nationalities politics of the Bolshevik, Stalinist, and the late Soviet socialism. The dissolution of the USSR, the rise of interethnic conflicts, and the relations between ethnic groups in Russia and the successor states are the focus of the second half of the course, where several case studies are discussed in depth.

     "In this course, we will discuss a variety of genres from Russian folklore. As we move from the familiar genre of the riddle to the often mystifying beliefs and rituals of the ancient Slavs and then to the fairy tale, comfortingly familiar from childhood, we will learn to not only recognize the richness and density of texts that may initially seem uncomplicated but also to discern the patterns and meanings behind the apparently exotic narratives and behaviors. By thoroughly studying one of the world’s richest oral traditions, Slavic folk life and folklore, we will acquire the tools and techniques necessary for collecting, documenting, and interpreting folklore -- which is perhaps the most truly international of all arts. The course is based on materials in Russian and East European cultures, but also draws from other traditions. Open to all classes.",

     "This course examines the impact which the turbulent history of twentieth- and twenty-first century Russia has had on literature and on writers struggling to defend their integrity. The beginning of the last century witnessed an unprecedented burst of literary and artistic creativity: the late flowering of the great realist tradition coincided with the advent of modernism, a worldview defined by an insatiable hunger for novelty, will to experiment, taste for scandal and provocation, and bohemian lifestyles. The modernist schools and movements—symbolism, futurism, acmeism, imagism, and suprematism—were terminated in the 1930s by Stalin. Since then, despite decades of censorship and material hardship, Russian writers have continued to produce one of the world’s greatest literatures. Readings will include Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita, Solzhenitsyn’s One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, works by such authors as Chekhov and Pasternak, and samples from the radical avant-garde. Readings will be supplemented by excursions into Russian cinema, fine arts, photography, cyber-punk and contemporary performance art.",

As he himself put the problem, ‘Is there any meaning in my life which the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy?’ In his quest for bulwarks against that fear, he studied the great philosophers and he examined closely the value system of the peasants. He found temporary relief in war and in marriage, but the definitive solution always eluded him. The evolution of this theme, and the formal devices by which Tolstoy expressed it in his prose, will be traced in the major novels, War and Peace and Anna Karenina.

The course will emphasize the homestead as economic property and the implications of its location, design, artifacts and domestic lifestyles for the cultivation of model subjects, consumers or citizens. Theoretical, empirical and interpretative materials in the course may touch on subjects as varied as housing and home ownership, shopping and hyperconsumption, food and kitchen culture, family values and the modeling of marriage and family life, the home improvement industry, and home and self makeovers on reality television.",

It is an interdisciplinary field to which the work of sociologists, psychologists, and occasionally scholars from other disciplines is relevant. This course introduces students to social psychology primarily, although not exclusively, from a sociological perspective. First, the course will acquaint students with the range of theoretical perspectives that have been used to study social psychology. Second, it will familiarize students with empirical research that has been done to examine these theories. Third, it will permit students to explore particular social psychological issues in greater depth both within and across particular perspectives within social psychology. Lastly, the course will illustrate the relevance of sociology per se for social psychology as well as the relevance of social psychology for sociology. In sum, this course is a general survey of the field that enables students to develop a critical but constructive sense of the theoretical and methodological issues in social psychology, and an understanding of the relevance of social psychology for other aspects of sociology.",

Its primary objective to question contemporary racial assumptions and enable students to think critically about how race, ethnicity, and diversity are constantly being constructed around and through themselves. Over a century ago W.E.B. DuBois wrote that “the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line” (1903). In the first decade of the 21st century, race remains one of the most salient features of the American experience and social geography. News of racial tensions, racial disparities in the quality of life, racial divides in public opinion, and beatings and killings based on racial animosity continue to surface regularly. The underlying message seems to be that race is conflict and if we want a good society, whether national or local, we should avoid the subject or at the very least, deflect it in favor of discussing ethnicity and social class instead. The purpose of this course is to understand this state of affairs and to question the future of racial and ethnic diversity in this country.",

It examines the organization and operation of different kinds of markets, different theories of how economic activity is organized, and the social factors that contribute to economic success or failure.

     "C. Wright Mills described “the sociological imagination” as that quality of mind with the ability to grasp the interplay of biography and history, of self and social structure, of private troubles and public issues. As we approach the end of the 20th century, various issues of class, race and gender inequalities and conflicts appear to dominate popular discourse and policy debates. This capstone seminar will explore current substantive and theoretical expressions of the sociological imagination for providing critical assistance in understanding some of the major social issues of our time. The seminar is designed to emphasize critical discussion through active participation and class presentations. Each student will complete a significant intellectual project which reflects her or his own sociological analysis about an important social issue. Open to senior sociology majors, and others only by permission of the instructor.",

For the Portuguese explorers, the 16th Century was a time of encounters with radical otherness. Their travels confronted them with physical and cultural realities that challenged every cultural assumption, every category of the real. It should not come as a surprise, then, that the first task of the discoverer was to organize a new vision, processing a flood of color, sound and light that threatened to overcome his resistance and impose a new autonomous system of perception and representation. His second task would be to come to grips with that radical otherness. Comparisons and contrasts would provide the first basic tool for “understanding” the Other and his world. They would also set the stage for legitimate appropriation of an ‘Other” that would be found lacing and inferior in the comparative process of apprehension. In mapping out the main processes that shape the colonial dynamics of seeing, knowing and appropriating during that period we will turn to the texts of Pero Vaz de Caminha, Pero de Magalhães Gândavo, Gabriel Soares de Sousa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto.",

Permission of the instructor is required.\n\nIn 11W at 12 (Section 2), Unveiling the Harem Dancer. The historical legacy of Orientalism continues to perpetuate a stereotypical image of the exotic female dancing body. We will consider the Oriental dancer as an entry point to examine contexts of the colonial encounter, global circulation, and postcolonial conditions. We will also explore issues of gender and sexuality in Arab Islamic culture and address questions about the social agency of the female dancer. Materials include theoretical texts, travel accounts, films, and performances. Dist. ART.\n\nIn 11W, at 10 (Section 1), Psychology of Clothing and Fashion. This course explores how we use clothes as we seek to understand ourselves, and the world around us. Clothing provides a frame of reference for interpreting abstract social processes. We will attempt to uncover the social meanings of appearances in their multifaceted contexts. Students will be challenged to think in an inclusive, integrative manner about concepts including historical meanings, cultural dynamics, issues of identity and community. Lectures, projects, critiques and field trips to the Hood Museum. Open to all classes.\n\nIn 11S at 11 12S: 2 (Section 2), The Tragedy and Comedy of Greece and Rome (Identical to, and described under, Classical Studies 2).",

Although it is an introduction to the use of voice in the theater, it is in no way limited to the actor.

Resonance, vocal freedom, and articulation will also be explored. Techniques for accessing emotional and psychological truth will be practiced as fundamental to the actor’s creative process. A groundwork will be laid for physical and vocal presence. Each student will be responsible for the development and practice of a vocal warm-up.

By providing intense, comparative experience of play going, the course intends to broaden students’ knowledge of the dramatic repertoire, to heighten their awareness of production approaches and values, and to encourage them to develop considered critical response to theater. Stu-dents will attend a number of required performances and in addition attend performances of their own choosing—normally a total of three plays per week. Productions will represent a variety of periods and styles of playwriting, and a similarly diverse range of production companies and approaches to performance. Weekly seminar meetings will focus on critical responses to plays and productions, with background provided by guests from the professional theater (directors, writers, performers, designers, critics). Students will maintain journals and provide brief written critiques.\n\nDist: ART; WCult: W. The staff.",

To achieve this excellence, Writing 2-3 enrolls students into intensive, seminar-style classes in which literary and other works (including the students’ own) are read closely, with attention to substance, structure, and style. The primary goal of Writing 2 is for students to learn to write clearly and with authority. By submitting themselves to the rigorous process of writing, discussing, and rewriting their papers, students come to identify and then to master the essential properties of the academic argument.\n\nIn Writing 3, students engage in the more sustained discourse of the research paper. These papers are not restricted to literary criticism but might employ the research protocol of other academic disciplines. Throughout the reading, writing, and research processes, students meet regularly with their teaching assistants and professors, who provide them with individualized assistance. Writing 2-3 is taken in lieu of Writing 5 and meets the college requirement for composition.\n\nStudents who take the Writing 2-3 sequence defer their First-Year Seminar until the spring term.
